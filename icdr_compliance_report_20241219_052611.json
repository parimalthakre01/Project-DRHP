All statements contained in this Prospectus that \nare not statements of historical fact constitute \u201cforward -looking statements\u201d. All statements regarding our \nexpected financial condition and res ults of operations, business, plans and prospects are \u201cforward -looking \nstatements\u201d. These forward -looking statements generally can be identified by words or phrases such as \u201caim\u201d, \n\u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201clikely to\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d,  \u201cseek to\u201d, \u201cshall\u201d, \u201cobjective\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \n\u201cproject\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cwill continue\u201d, \u201cwill pursue \u201d, \u201ccan\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d or other words or phrases of \nsimilar import.

Any significant social, political, economic or seasonal disruption, \nnatural calamities or civil disruptions in Rajasthan  could have an adverse effect on our business, results \nof operations and financial condition.  \n \n5. Our Power Purchase Agreements exposing us to certain risks that may adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations and financial condition.  \n \nFor further discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ from the expectations, see \u201c Risk \nFactors \u201d, \u201cOur Business \u201d and \u201c Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperations \u201d beginning on pages 31, 195 and 431, respectively.

The manner of calculation and presentation of some of the operational and financial \nperformance indicators, and the assumptions and estimates used in such calculation, may vary from that used by \nother companies in India and other j urisdictions.  \nUnless otherwise indicated, the industry -related information contained in this section is derived from a report \ntitled \u201cStrategic Assessment of the Indian Power and Renewable Energy Sector , dated November 2024, prepared \nby CRISIL Research, which has been prepared and issued  by CRISIL Research, appointed by us exclusively for \nthe purpose of understanding the industry in connection with the Issue and commissioned and paid for by our \nCompany in connection with the Issue (the \u201c CRISIL Report \u201d). The data included herein includes excerpts from \nthe CRISIL Report and may have been re -ordered by us for the purposes of presentation. Unless otherwise \nindicated, all financial, operational, industry and other related information derived from the CRISI L Report and \nincluded herein with respect to any particular year, refers to such information for the relevant calendar year. \ncopy of the CRISIL Report is available on the website of our Company at  https://ngel.in/page/industry -report . \nInternal Risks  \n \nRisks Relating to our Business  \n \n1. There is a concentrated pool of utilities and power purchasers for electricity generated by our plants and \nprojects.  Accordingly, we derived a significant portion (more than 87%) of our revenue from operations \nfrom our top five offtakers in Fiscal 2024, w ith our single largest offtaker contributing around 50% of our \nrevenue from operations in Fiscal 2024. Loss of any of these customers or a deterioration of their financial \ncondition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial c ondition.  \n \nSince the transmission and distribution of electricity are controlled in most Indian jurisdictions by central and \nstate government -utility companies, there is a concentrated pool of power purchasers for utility scale \nelectricity generated by our solar and wind plants and projects. As of September 30, 2024, we had 17 offtakers \nacross  41 solar projects and  11 wind projects. In the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in \nFiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, our offtakers were government agenci es and public utilities. We \nhad no private offtakers in these periods.  \nOur business is concentrated with our top 9 offtakers from which we had revenue in the six months period \nended September 30, 2024. The table below sets forth the revenue from operations derived from our top 5 \nand top 9 offtakers as well as our single largest offtaker for the periods indicated:  \n Revenue from largest offtaker  Revenue from top 5 offtakers  Revenue from top 9 offtakers \n(3) \nPeriod  in \u20b9 millions  Percentage \ncontribution \nof largest \nofftaker to \nrevenue from \noperations  in \u20b9 millions  Percentage \ncontribution \nof top 5 \nofftakers to \nrevenue from \noperations  in \u20b9 millions  Percentage  \ncontribution \nof top 9 \nofftakers to \nrevenue from \noperations  \nRestated \nConsolidated \nFinancial \nInformation (1)       \nSix months period \nended September 30, \n2024  5,094.56  47.07%  8,978.64  82.96%  10601.61  97.96%  \nFiscal 2024  9,755.34  49.71%  17,230.44  87.79%  19,160.79  97.63%  \nSpecial Purpose \nCarved -Out \nCombined Financial \nStatements (2)       \nFiscal 2023  4,613.11  31.82%  12,430.33  85.74%  14,285.98  98.54%  \nFiscal 2022  2,227.83  24.47%  8,192.74  89.99%  8,899.32  97.75%  \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscal 2024.

Accordingly, our business, \nresults of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected if our relationship with these top 9 \nofftakers is adversely affected. If any of these offtakers become unable or unwilling to fulfil their contractual \nobligations under the relevant PPA or refuse to accept power deliv ered under the PPAs or otherwise terminate \nsuch agreements prior to the expiration thereof, our assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of \noperations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Although the central and st ate \ngovernments in India have taken steps to improve the liquidity, financial condition and viability of state \nelectricity distribution utility companies, there can be no assurance that the utility companies that are currently \nour offtakers will have the r esources to pay on time or at all.  Furthermore, if the financial condition of these \nofftakers deteriorates or other government policies to which they are currently subject to change, demand for \nelectricity produced by our utility -scale solar and wind projects could be adversely impacted.   \n \nSee also, \u201c Risk Factors - Our inability to collect receivables in time or at all from our utility offtakers may \nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition \u201d  on page 45. \n \n2. Our business and profitability is substantially dependent on the availability and cost of solar modules, solar \ncells, wind turbine generators and other materials, components and equipment for our solar, wind and \nother projects. W e are dependent on third party suppliers for meeting our materials, component and \nequipment requirements, and our top 10 suppliers accounted for 92.65 %  and 77.71% of our supplies in \nthe six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, respectively. Any disruption to t he \ntimely and adequate supply, or volatility in the prices of required materials, components and equipment  \nmay adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n     \n34 \n Operating equipment for solar energy projects primarily consists of solar panels, inverters, cables, solar \nmounting structures, trackers, transmission lines and power evacuation systems. Operating equipment for \nwind energy projects primarily consists of wi nd turbines and components for power evacuation systems. We \npurchase major components such as solar panels, inverters, wind turbines and some components of power \nevacuation systems directly from a number of domestic and international manufacturers.  \nThe table below sets forth details on our largest supplier, our top ten suppliers and our top 20 suppliers for \nthe periods indicated.  \nSuppliers(3)  \n \n \n \nType of \nEquipment, \ncomponents and \nmaterials supplied Restated Consolidated Financial Information (1) \nSix months period ended \nSeptember 30, 2024   \nFiscal 2024  \n\u20b9 million  % of \nsupplies(2) \u20b9 million  % of \nsupplies(2) \nLargest Supplier  Solar modules  \nincluding \ninstallation  15,372.18  \n(Sterling & \nWilson \nRenewable \nEnergy \nLimited)  36.00 % 13,968.46 \n(Tata Power \nRenewable \nEnergy \nLimited ) 19.59%  \nTop 10 Suppliers  Solar Modules, \nWTG, land \nprocurement, \nbalance of supply, \nincluding \ninstallation  39,554.79  92.65%  55,407.64  77.71%  \nTo 20 Suppliers  Solar Modules, \nWTG, land \nprocurement, \nbalance of supply, \nincluding \ninstallation  40,866.36  95.72 % 57,676.86  \n 80.89%  \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and Fiscal 2024.

See    \n35 \n \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information\u201d on page 282. \n(2) Supplies also include installation, transportation and Operation & Maintenance services as per service agreements.  \n(3) Suppliers include EPC  contractors.  \n \nOur business and profitability are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of such materials, \ncomponents and equipment and we are dependent on third party suppliers for meeting these requirements. At \npresent, we do not have any long -term suppl y contracts with any of our materials, components or equipment \nsuppliers and typically source our requirements based on specific requirements. However, we may enter into \nlong-term agreements for the supply of critical capital expenditure components such as  solar modules, wind \nturbine generators and battery energy storage systems.  The market prices of solar modules and wind turbine \ngenerators, in particular, have fluctuated in recent years. For further information, see \u201cIndustry Overview\u201d on \npage 151. As we do not have long term supply contracts, we may be exposed to price increases for these \ncritical components which could impact our project margins and may adversely affect our business, results \nof operations and financial condition.  \nWe engage EPC contractors in both solar and wind projects through a competitive tender process. In solar \nprojects, we have diversified our strategy for setting up power plants from using a turnkey EPC contract \nmodel (where the contractor is responsible fro m concept through commissioning) to a model where we take \nresponsibility for procurement of major equipment and supplies and the contractor builds, commissions and \nhands over the solar plant. We also use the turnkey EPC contract model based on specific pro ject conditions. \nIn wind projects, we generally use the turnkey EPC model, entering into contracts with OEMs for \nmanufacturing, installing, and commissioning wind turbines and the balance of plant. However, we have also \nstarted bifurcating the total projec t scope into balance of plant (including procurement of land) and supply \nand installation of wind turbine generators.  \nAlthough we have not had any past instances of entering new contracts with alternative suppliers, if our EPC \nservices contractors and our suppliers do not perform their obligations, we may need to enter new into \ncontracts with other suppliers at a higher cost or may suffer schedule disruptions. In the past, we have had \none non -performing balance of systems contractor that was allowed to withdraw from its contract with us.  In \naddition, our suppliers may have difficulty in fulfil ling our orders and result in delays in delivery critical \nequipment, or charge us higher prices, higher up -front payments and deposits, which would result in higher -\nthan-expected prices or less favourable payment terms to develop our projects. Although we have not had \nany past instances where completion of our projects was delayed due to non -delivery of ordered materials, \ncomponents and equipment, any delays in the delivery of ordered materials, components and equipment could \ndelay the completion of our und er-construction projects. Any such delays or disruptions could materially and \nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  \n3. Our renewable energy project construction activities may be subject to cost overruns or delays which may \nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Further, our future \ngrowth is significantly dependent on suc cessfully executing our contracted and awarded projects. In the \nevent, we are not successful in executing our contracted and awarded projects, our business, results of \noperations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.  \n \nSubmitting a competitive bid for a renewable energy project requires extensive research, planning, and due \ndiligence and capacity to operate with low operating margins for sustained period of time. If we miscalculate \nor misjudge our tariff rates and incorr ectly factor the costs of construction, development, land acquisition and \nprice of the components, the economics of successful bids may be affected, and the projects may become \neconomically unviable. For instance, we estimate prices for system components a nd factor these costs into \nour bids, and if these prices vary from what we had anticipated, the profitability of our successful bids maybe \nadversely affected. Our suppliers may attempt to renegotiate supply contracts, if there is an increase in \ncomponent p rices, which may also increase our capital expenditure. We may also be required to incur \nunanticipated capital expenditure for interconnection rights, regulatory approvals, preliminary engineering \npermits, and legal and other expenses which could adversely  affect the profitability of the projects and, as a \nresult, our profitability.  \nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 16,896 MWs Operating, Contracted and Awarded including an Operating \ncapacity of 3,320 MWs and a Contracted & Awarded capacity of 13,576 MWs. We measure the rated capacity \nof our plants in megawatts in alternate current (AC). Rated capacity is the expected maximum output that a \npower plant can produce without exceeding its design limits. \u201cMegawatts Operating\u201d  represents the \naggregate megawatt rated capacity of renewable power plants that are commissioned and operational as of  \nthe reporting date. \u201cMegawatts Contracted & Awarded\u201d  represents the aggregate megawatt rated capacity of    \n36 \n renewable power plants as of the reported date which include (i) PPAs signed with customers, and (ii) capacity \nwon and allotted in auctions and where letters of award (\u201c LoAs \u201d) have been received.   \nThe following table sets forth our (i) megawatts operating, (ii) megawatts contracted & awarded and (iii) \nmegawatts operating, contracted and awarded, as of the end of the respective financial years/periods \npresented.  \nParticulars   \nCompany Operating Data  \n Carved -out \nOperating \nData(1) \nAs at \nSeptember 30,  \n2024  As at \nSeptember 30,  \n2023  As at March \n31, 2024  As at March \n31, 2023  As at March \n31, 2022  \nMegawatts Operating  \n   Solar (MWs)  3,220  2,661  2,825  2,561  1,395  \n   Wind (MWs)  100 50 100 50 50 \n   Total (MWs)  3,320  2,711  2,925  2,611  1,445  \nMegawatts Contracted & Awarded  \n   Solar (MWs)  10,576  7,050  9,571  5,750  4,616  \n   Wind (MWs)  3,000  1,550  2,000  500 150 \n   Total (MWs)  13,576  8,600  11,571  6,250  4,766  \nMegawatts Operating, Contracted & Awarded  \n   Solar (MWs)  13,796  9,711  12,396  8,311  6,011  \n   Wind (MWs)  3,100  1,600  2,100  550 200 \n   Total (MWs)  16,896  11,311  14,496  8,861  6,211  \n(1) Our Carved -out Operating Data as at March 31, 2022 is based  on the carved -out consolidated operating data pertaining to RE \nAssets  of NTPC Limited, NREL and our Company as at March 31, 2022.  This Carved -out Operating Data is not our operating \ndata under the leadership of our current management and board.  See \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out \nCombined Financial Statemen ts and Carved -out Operating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent \ncompany\u201d on page 38. \n \nOur future growth is significantly dependent on successfully executing our contracted and awarded projects. \nIn the event, we are not successful in executing our contracted and awarded projects, our business, results of \noperations and financial condition ma y be adversely impacted. In the six months period ended September 30, \n2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, we have not had any instances where an LoA was \ncancelled without execution of a PPA.  Further, in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in \nFiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, we have not had any instances where the projects which were \nawarded or contracted did not commence operations in accordance with the applicable PPAs or were \ndiscontinued for any reason.  For a summary of our PPAs on operational and contracted and awar ded projects, \nsee \u201c Our Business - Our Projects \u2013 Operational Projects \u201d and \u201c Our Business - Our Projects \u2013 Contracted \nand Awarded Projects \u201d on pages 216 and 217, respectively.  Construction of our solar, wind and other \nrenewable energy projects may be adversely affected by circumstances outside of our control, including \ninclement weather, adverse geological and environmental conditions, failure to receive regulatory approvals \non schedule or delay in land acquisition or delay in transmission system readiness o r third -party delays in \nproviding supplies and other materials.   \nIn six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, we have \nhad a few instances of delay in the past in connection with our GUVNL \u2013 I & II and Shajapur projects which \nwere primarily due to the COVID -19 pandemic and consequent supply chain disruptions. These delays ranged \nfrom 4 to 7 months. These delays did not result in material cost overruns and part of the capacity of these \ndelayed project s were declared operational as of September 30, 2024.  \n \nIn addition, the construction of hybrid solar and wind projects that are co -located to supply power into the \nsame pooling station is constrained because these projects require locations with good irradiation and \nexperience high wind speeds. For further information, see \u201cIndustry Overview \u2013 Constraints in Setting up \nHybrid Power Plants \u201d on page 176. Although we do not have any such project at present, we may find \nconstruction of co -located hybrid projects difficult in the future because of the difficulty in finding appropriate \nlocations.  \n \nMoreover, local political changes as well as demonstrations or protests by local communities or special \ninterest groups could result in, or contribute to, project development time and cost overruns for us. Changes \nin project plans or designs, or defective or late execution may increase our costs from our initial estimates    \n37 \n and cause delays. Increases in the prices of components and equipment may increase procurement costs. \nThere can be no assurance that the prices of components and equipment required for our power projects that \nare presently contracted and under construction  will not change, which may cause the economic returns \navailable from these projects to differ from our initial projections. Any fluctuations in prices of components \nor raw materials materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, fina ncial condition and \ncash flows. If we experience unexpected increases in procurement costs, our forecasted revenues and cash \nflows could be materially adversely affected.  \nFurther, as on the date of this Prospectus, our project portfolio consists of contracted and awarded projects \nwhich are currently being commissioned and operationalised. Most of these contracted and awarded projects \nare housed in our Material Subsidiary, N TPC Renewable Energy Limited. We are in the process of obtaining \nthe relevant authorisations, permissions and approvals such as the development permissions from the relevant \nstate and central authorities, including the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy;  energization approvals \nfrom the jurisdictional chief electrical inspectorate in accordance with the Central Electricity Authority \n(Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations, 2010 and clearance from the Central Ground \nWater Authority or the State Ground Water Authority.  \nAlthough we have not had any past instances, labour shortages, work stoppages, labour disputes or disruptions \nin transportation bringing in labour for projects could significantly delay a project, increase our costs or cause \nus to breach our performance gu arantees under our PPAs, particularly because strikes and labour \ntransportation disruptions are not considered a force majeure event under many of our PPAs. Moreover, \nalthough we have not had any past instances, local political changes and delays, for inst ance, caused by state \nand local elections, as well as demonstrations or protests by local communities and special interest groups \ncould result in, or contribute to, project time and cost overruns for us.  \nIn addition, we utilize and rely on third -party sub -contractors to construct and install portions of our \nrenewable energy projects. If our subcontractors do not satisfy their obligations or do not perform work that \nmeets our quality standards or if there i s a shortage of third -party subcontractors or if there are labour strikes \nthat interfere with the ability of our employees or contractors to complete their work on time or within budget, \nwe could experience significant delays or cost overruns. Though, most  of our contracts are Firm Price \nContracts and we also have the provision to impose liquidated damages for delays, there can be instances that \nwe may not be able to recover such losses in connection with cost overruns or delays.  \nAny such contingencies that could lead us to fail to generate our expected return from our solar, wind and \nother renewable energy projects and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition and cash flows.  \n4. In the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, 62.20% and 61.74%, respectively, \nof our operating renewable energy projects are concentrated in Rajasthan . Any significant social, political, \neconomic or seasonal disruption, natural calamities or civil disruptions in Rajasthan  could have an adverse \neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nAs on the date of this Prospectus, our operating renewable energy projects are concentrated in Rajasthan.

See \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements and Carved -out Operating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent company \u201d on page 38. \n \nDue to the geographic concentration of our operations, we are susceptible to local and regional factors, such \nas economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, political, demographic and population changes, \nadverse regulatory developments civil unrest  and other unforeseen events and circumstances. Such \ndisruptions could result in the damage or destruction of a significant portion of our mining capabilities, \nsignificant delays in production and/or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, resu lts of \noperations and financial condition. The occurrence of any of these events could require us to incur significant \ncapital expenditure or change our business structure or strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our \nbusiness, results of operatio ns and financial condition. While we have not faced any such disruptions in the \npast in our operations due to the concentration of our operating projects in Rajasthan, we cannot assure you \nthat there will not be any significant developments in these region s in the future that may adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \n5. Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements and Carved -Out Operating Data for \nFiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 may not be representative of our results as an independent company.  \n \nOur Company was incorporated on April 7, 2022 for the reorganisation of NTPC Limited\u2019s renewable energy \nbusiness. Pursuant to the issuance of National Monetisation Pipeline (\u201c NMP \u201d) by the Ministry of Finance on \nAugust 23, 2021, and in consultation with the Ministry of Power, the RE Assets of NTPC Limited were \ntransferred to our Company at book value, through a business transfer agreement dated July 8, 2022. Further, \nNTPC Limited a lso transferred 100% of its equity shareholding held in NTPC Renewable Energy Limited \n(\u201cNREL \u201d) to our Company through a share purchase agreement dated July 8, 2022. The transfer of the RE \nassets and 100% equity shareholding in NREL, were completed on February 28, 2023.  \n \nAs a result, in Fiscal 2023, we had 31 days of operation from February 28, 2023. Our Restated Consolidated \nFinancial Information for the period from April 7, 2022 to March 31, 2023, to which we refer as \u201cFiscal \n2023\u201d, and for Fiscal 2024 were prepared on a n actual basis.  For comparative purposes, we have also prepared \nSpecial Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, which includes \nthe carved -out business in respect of the RE Assets (part of the standalone financial statements of NTPC \nLimited until February 28, 2023) which has been combined with the standalone financial statements of NREL \nfor the year ended March 31, 2022 and our consolidated  financial statements  for the year ended March 31, \n2023. The Special Purpos e Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements are audited by two of the prior \nstatutory auditors of NTPC Limited. Similarly, certain operating data and key performance indicators for \nFiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2023 are presented on a carved -out basis. This specia l purpose carved -out combined \nfinancial information and Carved -out Operating Data and key performance indicators are not of our Company \nand its consolidated subsidiaries and joint venture under the leadership of our current management and board. \nFurther, w e have made numerous estimates, assumptions and allocations in our special purpose carved -out \ncombined financial information and Carved -out Operating Data and key performance indicators as NTPC did \nnot account for us, and we did not operate, as a separate entity, for any period prior to April 7, 2022. The use \nof such assumptions and estimates means that the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements and Carved -out Operating Data and key performance indicators for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2023 \npresented in this Prospectus may not to be representative of what our financial condition, results of operations, \ncash flow or operating performance would have been had we been a separate entity during the periods \npresented. Furthermore, neither the Restated  Consolidated Financial Information nor the Special Purpose    \n39 \n Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements should be used to forecast or accurately predict our future \nperformance with any degree of certainty.   \n \n6. Our Power Purchase Agreements may expose us to certain risks that may adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are required to give performance bank \nguarantees guaranteeing the commencement of supply of power which could adversely affect our results \nof operation if invoked. Further, our revenue from operations are exposed to fixed tariffs, changes in \ntariff regulation and structuring.  \n  \nWe generate all of our revenue from electricity sold to offtakers under long -term PPAs with a 25 year term. \nThe tables below set out our renewable energy sales for the periods indicated.  \n(\u20b9 in million ) \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated Financial  \nInformation (1) Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements (2) \n \n \n \nFiscal 2024   \n \nFiscal 2023   \n \nFiscal 2022  \n (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue \nfrom \noperations  (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue \nfrom \noperations  (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue \nfrom \noperations  \nRenewable \nEnergy Sales        \nSolar  18,403.54  93.77%  13,651.81  94.17%  8,447.56  92.79%  \nWind   471.02  2.40%  401.30  2.77%  400.80  4.40%  \nTotal \nRenewable \nEnergy Sales  18,874.56  96.17%  14,053.11  96.94%  8,848.36  97.19%  \nRevenue from \noperations(3) 19,625.98   14,497.09   9,104.21   \n \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated Financial  \nInformation (1) \nSix months period ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024  Six months period ended  \nSeptember 30, 2023  \n (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue from \noperations  (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue from \noperations  \nRenewable Energy \nSales      \nSolar  9825.02  90.78%  9,514.17  94.36%  \nWind   503.20  4.65%  255.09  2.53%  \nTotal Renewable \nEnergy Sales  10,328.22  95.43%  9,769.26  96.89%  \nRevenue from \noperations(3) 10,822.91   10,083.21   \n \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for \nFiscal 2024.

This carved -out financial information is not our financial information \nunder th e leadership of our current management and board.  See \u201cSpecial Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements\u201d \non page 365. See also \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements and Carved -out \nOperating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent company\u201d on page 38. \n(3) Revenue from operations is set forth in our Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months periods ended \nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 and for Fiscal 2024 and our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements for Fiscal \n2023 and Fiscal 2022.  \n \nUnder a long -term PPA, we typically sell power generated from a power plant to central government owned \nintermediaries or state distribution companies, at pre -determined fixed tariffs. The project may not yet be \nconstructed and/or commissioned for commerci al operation. The terms of our PPAs are 25 years from the \ndate of commercial operation or scheduled commissioning dates of the projects, as applicable.  \nUnder some of our PPAs, we are required to furnish and maintain a performance bank guarantee from the \ndate of submission of such guarantee to the date as specified in the PPA for guaranteeing the commencement \nof supply of power. There have been no instances in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in    \n40 \n Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022  where we failed to commence supply of power from the scheduled \ndate of commissioning specified in the PPA.  In the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in \nFiscal 2024 , Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, the average time for commissioning of our projects has been 18 to \n24 months. In the event there is a failure in the future to commence supply of power from the scheduled date \nof commissioning (including extensions thereof) specified in the PPA, such failure may re sult in liquidation \nof performance bank guarantees and on complete liquidation, the non -commissioned capacity is likely to be \nterminated by the offtaker. While there have been no such instances where our performance bank guarantees \nhave been invoked in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and \nFiscal 2022 , we cannot assure you that such instances will not happen in the future. In the event such \nguarantees are invoked, our business, results of operations financial con dition may be adversely affected. \nFurther, in the event we seek an extension of the term of a PPA, we are not likely to be able to renegotiate \nthe terms of the PPA to include a higher tariff rate.  \nTypically, once we have won a bid, we are awarded a LoA subsequent to which we sign the PPAs. We \ncalculate our megawatts Awarded and Contracted for projects for which we have LoAs or PPAs.  In the event \nthere are delays in the execution of PPAs after we ar e awarded an LoA or the LoA is cancelled without the \nexecution of a PPA, we may not be able to develop the projects on time which may impact our operational \ncapacity as well as result in loss of revenue from operations from sale of power. Further, our MWs Awarded \nand Contracted as reported would be reduced.  Such factors may limit our business flexibility, expose us to \nan increased risk of unforeseen business and industry changes and could have an adverse effect on our \nbusiness, results of operations and ca sh flows.  \nOur profitability is largely a function of our ability to manage our costs during the terms of the PPAs and \noperate our power projects at optimal levels. If we are unable to manage our costs effectively or operate our \npower projects at optimal levels, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may \nbe adversely affected. Our PPAs typically allow an offtaker to terminate the agreement or demand penalties, \nfines or charges from us upon the occurrence of certain events, including bu t not limited to, the failure to \nmaintain its controlling shareholding; complete project construction or connection to the transmission grid by \na certain date; supply the minimum amount of power specified; comply with prescribed operation and \nmaintenance r equirements; obtain regulatory approvals and licenses; comply with technical parameters set \nforth in grid codes and regulations; and comply with other material terms of the relevant PPAs.  \n \nThe table below sets forth penalties paid under our PPAs during the periods indicated.  \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated Financial Information (1) Special Purpose Carved -Out \nCombined Financial Statements (2) \n \nAs at \nSeptember 30, \n2024  As at \nSeptember 30, \n2023  As at March \n31, 2024  As at March \n31, 2023  As at March \n31, 2022  \nPenalties paid  \n(\u20b9 million)  0.25 - 2.51 2.97 - \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for \nFiscal 2024. See \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information\u201d on page 282.   For our Restated Consolidated Financial \ninformation for Fiscal 2023, see \u201cSummary Financial Information\u201d on page 96 and \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial \nInformation\u201d on page 282. \n(2) Based on Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, which includes the carved -\nout business in respect of RE Assets (part of the standalone financial statements of NTPC Limited until February 28, 2023) wh ich \nhas been combined with the standalone financial statements of NREL for the year ended March 31, 2022 and our consolidated \nfinancial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023.  This carved -out financial information is not our financial information \nunder th e leadership of our current management and board.  See \u201cSpecial Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements\u201d \non page 365. See also \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements and Carved -out \nOperating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent company\u201d on page 38.  \n \nFurthermore, most of our PPAs allow termination on a case -by-case basis in the event force majeure event(s) \ncontinue for an extended period of time. In instances of PPA termination where we are entitled to receive \ntermination payments from a counterparty o r distribution company due to such counterparty\u2019s or distribution \ncompany\u2019s material breach, there can be no certainty that such counterparty or distribution company will \nmake such payments on time or at all. Further, it is unlikely that termination paymen ts will be adequate to \npay all the outstanding third -party debt that we have borrowed for the project.  \n \nIn some of our PPAs, in the event of an early commissioning of the projects prior to the scheduled \ncommissioning date, the offtaker has the right of first refusal, and may purchase the generated power, only \nwith the consent of the buying utilities at a red uced tariff (in the case of early part -commissioning) as per the    \n41 \n conditions of the PPA. Similarly, any excess generation, over and above the maximum contracted energy \ndefined in the PPA, would be subject to the consent of the buying utility and right of first refusal of the \nprocurer and shall be purchased at a reduced t ariff as per the conditions of the PPA. If refused by the procurer, \nthe same can be sold in the open market. Therefore, the prices at which we supply power may have little or \nno relationship with the costs incurred in generating power, which may lead to fl uctuations in our margins.  \nCertain of our PPAs allow our offtakers to purchase the relevant project from us under certain circumstances. \nSome of the PPAs also entitle our lenders to appoint another party as the operator of our projects, under \ncertain circumstances, such as the creat ion of security contravening the terms of the relevant PPAs, \nbankruptcy, insolvency or winding up proceedings against a power generator, or a change in control event \nwithout the lender\u2019s consent. If we are unable to acquire the project, the lenders may enf orce their mortgage \nrights under the respective credit agreements, and the project may be acquired by the lenders or the offtakes. \nIf such buyouts or step -ins occur and we are unable to locate and acquire suitable replacement projects on \ntime or at all, ou r business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and \nadversely affected.  \n \nAs counterparties in our PPAs are central or state government entities or government -backed corporations, \nour ability to negotiate the terms of the PPAs, which are generally standard form contracts, is limited. Our \nPPAs are generally not subject to revisio ns. Accordingly, if there is an industry -wide increase in tariffs or if \nwe are seeking an extension of the term of the PPA, we will not be able to renegotiate the terms of the PPA \nto take advantage of the increased market tariffs. In addition, in the event  of increased operational costs, we \nwill not have the ability to reflect a corresponding increase in our tariffs. While our PPAs provide for tariff \nincrease due to \u201cchange in law,\u201d any such increase in tariff requires regulatory approvals from the CERC or \nany other regulatory commission which can be time consuming. We also may face difficulties in recovering \nthe costs (whether by tariff increases or litigation) through such corrective measures, from the respective \ncentral government owned intermediaries /st ate distribution companies/authorities in a timely manner and \nmay also face resistance from the regulators when we seek increases in tariffs. Although there have been no \nsuch incidents in the past, this may lead to disputes and impact our business, results  of operations, financial \ncondition and cash flows.  \nFurther, our PPAs also have restrictions on changes in management and the ownership of our project \nsubsidiary undertaking the relevant project (including changes in the specified minimum equity shareholding \nof the relevant holding company or selected bidde r in such project subsidiary).  \nAll the above factors limit our business flexibility, expose us to an increased risk of unforeseen business and \nindustry changes and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash \nflows.  \n7. The acquisition of the purchased renewable energy assets is subject to certain post closing actions, which \nare currently in the process of being fulfilled. Any failure to fulfil the post -closing actions may reduce the \nanticipated benefits of the acquisitio n, may impose limitations or costs on our Company or result in a \nmaterial adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of our \nCompany.  \n \nOur Company entered into a business transfer agreement dated July 8, 2022 (\u201c BTA \u201d), with our Corporate \nPromoter, NTPC Limited, pursuant to which NTPC Limited, under the approved asset monetization scheme \nfor the monetization of Renewable Energy (RE) assets, transferred the right, title and interest in the RE Assets \nfree and clear of a ll encumbrances other than the permitted encumbrances ( as defined in the BTA ).  The RE \nAssets under the BTA included inter -alia all contracts/documents, plant and equipment and permits held by \nNTPC Limited in relation to such assets. However, the complete consummation of the acquisition of the RE \nAssets was subject to certain post -closing actions such as the execution of assignment /novation agreements \nwith third parties in relation to the contracts that have been transferred to us, save for the PPA relating to the \nRojmal wind plant, all consents for novation, transfer or sublease of land have been executed except in respect \nof the J etsar and Rojmal projects. While we are in the process of completing all requisite post -closing actions, \nthe required transfers or assignments may take longer than expected to obtain, may not be granted and/or the \nthird parties may, as a condition to grant ing their approval or confirmation, impose limitations or costs. This \ncould reduce the benefits of the RE Assets or result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of \noperations and financial condition.  \n \n \n8. We intend to use a majority of our Net Proceeds from the Issue towards the repayment or prepayment, in    \n42 \n full or in part, of certain outstanding borrowings availed by our wholly owned Subsidiary, NTPC \nRenewable Energy Limited.   \n \nWe intend to utilise a portion of our Net Proceeds aggregating to \u20b9 75,000.00 million  in the form of \ninvestment in equity or debt or a combination of both or in any other manner as may be decided by our \nBoard, in accordance with Applicable Law, after cons idering certain commercial and financial factors, for \nrepayment and/ or prepayment, in full or part, of certain borrowings availed by our wholly owned Subsidiary  \nNTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL) from banks and financial institutions.  \nNREL, has entered into various borrowing arrangements, including borrowings in the form of terms loans \nand various fund based and non -fund based working capital facilities. The actual mode of such deployment \nwill be finalised at the time of investment. As on September 30, 2024, NREL had outstanding borrowings \n(fund based) of \u20b9 92,046.86  million  on a consolidated basis. NREL is engaged the business of building and \noperating renewable energy projects and its major source of revenue is renewable energy projects .  For further \ninformation on NREL and select financial information, see \u201c History and Certain Corporate Matters \u201d on page \n243.   \nThe details of the borrowings availed by availed by NREL along with purpose for which such borrowing is \navailed/used, which are currently proposed to be fully or partially repaid or prepaid (earlier or scheduled) \nfrom the Net Proceeds are set forth in \u201c Objects of the Issue - Details of the Objects of the Net Proceeds \u201d on \npage 125.  \nFor further information, See \u201c Object of the Issue \u201d on page 124. \n \n9. We are dependent on our relationship with our Corporate Promoter, NTPC Limited, and any adverse \ndevelopments in such relationship may adversely affect our business and reputation.   \n \nCurrently, our Corporate Promoter, NTPC Limited, owns an aggregate of 100% of our issued, subscribed and \npaid-up Equity Share capital. Following the completion of the Issue, our Corporate Promoter will continue to \nhold 89.00%   of our post -Issue Equity Share capital. We are benefiting relationship with our Corporate \nPromoter.  \nThe \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name and logo do not belong to us, which is registered in the name of our Corporate \nPromoter with the trademark registry. Although we have consent to use their name, we do not have a formal \nagreement with, or pay, our Corporate Promot er for the use of the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name or logo, and \nthere is no assurance that we will continue to be able to use the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name or logo in \nconnection with our business, which in turn may result in us being unable to capitalize on the bra nd \nrecognition associated with the NTPC\u201d trademark.  For more information, see \u201c - We do not own the \u201cNTPC\u201d \ntrademark, name or logo, and our logo and name have not been registered as trademarks.  Accordingly, our \nability to use our name or logo may be impaired. We also rely on a combination of trade secret and \ncontractual restrictions to  protect our intellectual property. If we are unable to protect our intellectual \nproperty rights, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely  affected. As part \nof our operations, we might infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and any misappropriation \nof our intellectual property could harm our competitive position .\u201d on page 73. \nOur borrowing facility between Japan Bank for International Cooperation and NREL is supported by a \nguarantee by our Corporate Promoter.  This facility may need to be refinanced if such guarantee was \nwithdrawn for any reason. For more information, \u201c -One of our borrowing facilities is supported by a \nguarantee by our Promoter and may need to be refinanced if such guarantee was withdrawn for any reason .\u201d  \non page 76. \nExcept for our Executive Directors, all Key Managerial Personnel, Senior Management Personnel and all of \nour employees are on secondment from NTPC Limited.  There is no secondment agreement between the \nCompany and NTPC Limited.  The secondments are pursuan t to office orders and the terms of which may be \naltered at any time.  \nOur Corporate Office has been taken on lease from our Corporate Promoter vide lease agreement dated April \n8, 2024 . Over 2,809.26 acres of land at Barethi, Madhya Pradesh has been leased to us by our Corporate \nPromoter for a period of 29 years commencing from August 31, 2023     \n43 \n Additionally, our Company entered into a business transfer agreement dated July 8, 2022 with our Corporate \nPromoter for the transfer of fifteen Renewable Energy (RE) assets of the Company. However, since the \napproval for assignment / novation of the land p ertaining to Rojmal project and Jetsar project, included in the \nabove transferred RE assets, haven\u2019t yet been consented by the respective lessors, they have been retained in \nthe books of our Corporate Promoter. Our Company, has accordingly entered into a r ight-of-use (ROU) \nagreement with our Corporate Promoter for the use of land pertaining to these projects, pending transfer of \nthe lease -hold rights.  \nWe cannot assure you that our relationship with our Corporate Promoter will not deteriorate in the future. \nOur credit ratings and ability to raise financing are also affected by our Corporate Promoter\u2019s \ncreditworthiness, and the loss of its support could a dversely affect our business and reputation.  \n \n10. We have incurred substantial indebtedness, and an inability to comply with repayment and other covenants \nin our financing agreements could adversely affect our business and financial condition.  \nAs at September 30, 2024, we had aggregate outstanding borrowings (including current borrowings and non -\ncurrent borrowings) of \u20b9170,574.96 million. Our debt to equity ratio has been increased from 1.11  times as \nat March 31, 2023  to 2.08 times  as at September 30, 2024 .

These \nborrowings are secured, inter alia , through a charge by way of hypothecation on the present and future moveable \nassets (excluding current assets) in relation to our projects, and our receipts under the power purchase agreement \npertaining to our renewable energy projects, to the extent of a mount of interest/principal due for repayment    \n44 \n under the respective loan agreement entered with our lenders. For further details, see \u201c Financial Indebtedness \u201d \non page 516, \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information \u2013 Note 15 \u2013 Non-current financial liabilities -\nBorrowings \u201d on page 328 and \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information \u2013 Note 19 \u2013 Current financial \nliabilities - Borrowings \u201d on page 330. As most of these  secured assets pertain to our renewable energy projects, \nour rights in respect of transferring or disposing of these assets are restricted. In the event we fail to service our \ndebt obligations, the lenders have the right to enforce the security in respect  of our secured borrowings and \ndispose of our assets to recover  the amounts due from us. Any such enforcement of lenders security interests \nagainst us would adversely affect our business, results operations and financial condition.  \nSome of the financing arrangements entered into by us include conditions that require our Company and our \nSubsidiaries to obtain respective lenders\u2019 consent prior to carrying out certain activities (including certain \ncorporate actions) and entering into ce rtain transactions. Failure to meet these conditions or obtain these \nconsents could have significant consequences on our business and operations. These covenants vary \ndepending on the requirements of the financial institution extending such loan and the co nditions negotiated \nunder each financing agreement. Some of the corporate actions that require prior consents or intimations to \nbe made to certain lenders include, amongst others -, (i) effecting any change in ownership, control capital \nstructure or shareholding pattern and/or management of our Company, (ii) undertaking any amendment  in the \nconstitutional documents, (iii) changing the general nature of business . While we have received all relevant \nconsents required for the purposes of this Issue and have com plied with these covenants, a failure to comply \nwith such covenants in the future may restrict or delay certain actions or initiatives that we may propose to \ntake from time to time.  \nAny failure on our part to comply with these terms in our financing agreements including  the security \nagreements would generally result in events of default under these financing agreements. In such a case, the \nlenders under each of these respective loan agreements may, at their discretion, accelerate payment and declare \nthe entire outstandin g amounts under these loans due and payable, and in certain instances, enforce their security \nwhich has been constituted. While there has been no violation of any restr ictive covenants and no event of default \nhas occurred and we have not rescheduled repayment of loans in relation to debt financing availed by our \nCompany and our Subsidiaries since its incorporation, we cannot assure that this will continue to be the case in \nthe future.  \n \nA failure to observe the covenants under our financing arrangements or to obtain necessary consents/ waivers \nmay lead to acceleration of amounts due under such facilities enforcement of security. If the obligations under \nany of our financing documents are accelerated, we may have to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from \noperations to make payments under such financing documents, thereby reducing the availability of cash for our \nworking capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. In additio n, during any period in which we \nare in default, we may be unable to raise, or face difficulties raising, further financing. For further details of the \nterms and conditions of our borrowing arrangements, see \u201c Financial Indebtedness \u201d on page  516. \n \n11. We face significant competition from both traditional and renewable energy companies and any failure to \nrespond to market changes in the renewable energy industry could adversely affect our business, financial \nconditions and results of operations.  \n  \nWe face significant competition in the markets in which we operate. Our primary competitors are Indian and \ninternational developers and operators of solar projects, wind projects and other renewable energy sources. \nDeregulation of the Indian power sector and increased private sector investment have intensified the \ncompetition we face. The Electricity Act, 1948 or the Electricity Act, 2003 removed certain lic ensing \nrequirements for power generation companies, provided for open access to transmission and distribution \nnetworks and also facilitated additional capacity through captive power projects. These and other similar \nfuture reforms do and will provide oppor tunities for increased private sector participation in power generation.  \n  \nFurthermore, our competitors may have greater operational, financial, technical, management or other \nresources to achieve better economies of scale and lower cost of capital, allowing them to bid in the same \nauction at more competitive rates. Our competito rs may also have a more effective or established localized \nbusiness presence or a greater willingness or ability to operate with little or no operating margins for sustained \nperiods of time. Our competitors may also enter into strategic alliances or form a ffiliates with other \ncompetitors to our detriment. Moreover, suppliers or contractors may merge with our competitors which may \nlimit our choices of suppliers or contractors and hence the flexibility of our overall project execution \ncapabilities. In additio n, some of our competitors have developed their own internal solar panel manufacturing \ncapabilities. As the renewable energy industry grows and evolves, we may also face new competitors who    \n45 \n are not currently in the market. In addition, we face competition from developers of other renewable energy \nfacilities, including biomass, and nuclear, as well as other forms of renewable electricity generation like green \nhydrogen. Competition from such pr oducers may increase if the technology used to generate electricity from \nthese other renewable energy sources becomes more sophisticated, or if the GoI elects to further strengthen \nits support of such renewable energy sources. Any increase in competition d uring the bidding process or \nreduction in our competitive capabilities could materially and adversely affect our market share and the profit \nthat we generate from our projects.  Further, we compete with traditional energy companies using fossil fuels \nto pr oduce power. As of September 2024, installed grid connected renewable energy generation capacity \n(including large hydro) in India constituted approximately 45% of the total installed generation base with \ntraditional energy generation accounting for the rem aining 57%.  (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024). \nFor the weighted average rates of the sale of power, see diagram \u201c Weighed average rate of sale of power \u201d in \n\u201cIndustry Overview \u2013 Installed Renewable energy capacity in India \u201d on page 161. In the event of lower cost \nof coal, oil, natural gas, diesel fuel and other fossil fuels, these traditional energy companies may reduce \ndemand for renewable energy and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \n12. Our inability to collect receivables in time or at all from our utility offtakers which adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nWe generate electricity income primarily pursuant to PPAs with offtakers which are central and state \ngovernment -run utilities.

Our counterparties to our PPAs may \nbecome subject to financial stress, ins olvency or liquidation proceedings during the term of the relevant \ncontracts, and the credit support received from such customers may not be sufficient to cover our losses in \nthe event of a failure to perform. There may also be disputes raised by the count erparties to the amounts \ninvoiced, or delays associated with collection of receivables from government owned or controlled entities \non account of the financial condition of these entities that deteriorated significantly in the past. For \ninformation on ongo ing disputes, see \u201c Outstanding Litigation and  Other Material Developments \u201d on page \n521.    \n47 \n The Governmental entities to which we sell power generally may not have credit ratings for us to consider, \nand many of the state governments in India, if rated, would likely rate lower than the GoI. Although the \ncentral and state governments in India have take n steps to improve the liquidity, financial condition and \nviability of state electricity distribution utility companies, there can be no assurance that the utility companies \nthat are currently our customers will have the resources to pay on time or at all.  \nIn addition, our PPA customers may, for any reason, become unable or unwilling to fulfil their related \ncontractual obligations, refuse to accept delivery of power delivered thereunder or otherwise terminate such \nagreements prior to the expiration thereof. If such events occur, our business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  \nMacroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties, including insolvency, for our customers, \nand as a result could cause customers to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment \narrangements, that could increase our recei vables or affect our working capital requirements, or default on \ntheir payment obligations to us. An increase in bad debts or in defaults by our customers, may compel us to \nutilize greater amounts of our operating working capital and result in increased in terest costs, thereby \nadversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \n13. We face risks and uncertainties when developing our renewable energy projects, which may result in delays \nin commissioning which could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition and cash flows.  \n  \nThe development and construction of our projects (wind and solar) involve numerous risks and uncertainties \nand require extensive research, planning and due diligence. Before we determine that a project is \neconomically, technologically or otherwise feasible , we may be required to incur significant capital \nexpenditure for land and interconnection rights, regulatory approvals, preliminary engineering, equipment \nprocurement, legal and other matters. Success in developing a project depends on many factors, inclu ding:  \n   \n\u25cf accurately assessing resources availability at levels deemed acceptable for project development and \noperations;  \n \n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates impacting equipment and supplier costs;  \n \n\u25cf fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and purchased components;  \n \n\u25cf receiving critical components and equipment (that meet our design specifications) on schedule and on \nacceptable commercial terms;  \n \n\u25cf securing necessary project approvals, licenses and permits in a timely manner;  \n \n\u25cf securing appropriate land, with satisfactory land use permits, on reasonable terms;  \n \n\u25cf availability of adequate grid infrastructure and obtaining rights to interconnect the project to the grid \nor to transmit energy;  \n \n\u25cf obtaining financing on competitive terms;  \n \n\u25cf completing construction on schedule without any unforeseeable delays; and  \n \n\u25cf entering PPAs or other off take arrangements on acceptable terms.  \n  \nGenerally, our PPAs require that we bring our projects to commercial operation by a certain date. There may \nbe delays or unexpected difficulties in completing our projects because of these or other factors. In the six \nmonths period ended September 30 , 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, we have not had \nmaterial instances of delay in receipt of equipment and materials for our projects.  We may also have to reduce \nthe size of some of our projects due to occurrence of any of these factors. If  we are unable to adhere to project \ntimelines for reasons other than as specifically contemplated in the PPAs, it could result in penalties, including \npaying liquidated damages of to six months for delay in commissioning of projects or granting the off tak er \nthe right to draw on performance bank guarantees provided by us, including in certain cases up to 100% of \nthe bank guarantee, or the termination of the PPAs for delays beyond six months. Further, we may also be \nsubject to penalties in respect of our fai lure to meet the generation obligations under the PPA. If we experience \nsuch problems, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and    \n48 \n adversely affected.  \n \n14. Our in -house procurement operations for solar projects expose us to certain risks. We may incur \nunexpected expenses if the suppliers of components in our power projects default on their warranty \nobligations.  \n  \nIn solar projects, we usually take responsibility for procurement of major equipment and supplies and the \ncontractor builds, commissions and hands over the solar plant. We also use the turnkey EPC contract model \nbased on specific project conditions. In wind projects, we generally use the turnkey EPC model, entering into \ncontracts with OEMs for  manufacturing, installing, and commissioning wind turbines and the balance of \nplant.  Entering third -party EPC contracts on the basis of fixed price contracts insulate us from adverse price \nfluctuations for the equipment and materials we use for construct ing solar and wind projects. However, we \nare exposed to construction cost risks that could be caused by various factors, including:  \n   \n\u25cf increases in the price and availability of land, labour, equipment and materials;  \n \n\u25cf inaccuracies of drawings and technical information;  \n \n\u25cf delays in the delivery of equipment and materials to project sites;  \n \n\u25cf unanticipated increases in equipment, material and land costs;  \n \n\u25cf delays caused by local and seasonal weather conditions; and  \n \n\u25cf any other unforeseen design and engineering issues, or physical, site and geological conditions that \nmay rresult in delays.  \nAdditionally, we are responsible for all equipment and construction defects. Although we generally obtain \nwarranties from our equipment suppliers and take third -party insurance in the event that solar module \nmanufacturers do not honour their warranties, we  cannot assure that we will be successful with any warranty \nclaims against our suppliers or claims against such insurers. If our procurement operations are insufficient, \nwe may experience significant delays or disruption of our operations. The construction  projects are capital \nintensive, requires significant time and are subject to delays or cost overruns, which could require us to expend \nadditional capital and adversely affect our business and operating results. Such potential events include \nshortages and late delivery of building materials and facility equipment, installation, commissioning and \nqualification of equipment, labour disputes, delays or failure in securing the necessary governmental \napprovals, building sites or land use rights, and other change s to plans necessitated by changes in market \nconditions. Such delays could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and \ncash flows.  \n \n15. Our Company accounts are subject to a supplementary audit by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor \nGeneral of India, and any qualifications in their report on our financial statements could adversely affect the \ntrading price our Equity Shares.   \nOur accounts are subject to a supplementary audit by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India \n(\u201cC&AG \u201d) as required under the Companies Act.  For Fiscal 2024, the C&AG observed that a capital grant \nreceived from SECI under the MNRE scheme was for setting up of Solar PV Power Projects to meet out the \ncapital expenditure (acquisition of long -term assets); h owever, this capital grant should have been classified as \ninvesting activity whereas we classified this grant under financing activities i n our Fiscal 2024 Cash Flow \nStatement. For Fiscal 2023, the C&AG observed that we deposited \u20b9116.06 million with NTPC Limited for the \ntransfer of land for our Rojmal and Jetsar solar projects, which should be classified under \"Capital Advances\" \nas per Ind AS Schedule III. Instead, C&AG observed that it was misclassified under \"Current Financial Assets\" \nas claims recoverable. This misclassification led to the understatement of \"Other Non -Current Assets\" and the \noverstatement of \"Current Financial Assets.\" Ad ditionally, there was no disclosure about the land transfer status \nor area, which is required since the land will be transferred for lease.  \n \nThere is no assurance that the C&AG audit for any future fiscal periods will not contain such comments or any \nother qualifications for such future fiscal periods. Investors should consider these remarks in evaluating our \nresults of operations and financial  condition. Any such qualifications in the C&AG\u2019s report on our financial \nstatements in the future could adversely affect the trading price of our Equity Shares.  \n    \n49 \n 16. There is a time gap between making significant upfront investments in our solar, wind and other renewable \nenergy projects and receiving revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of \noperations and financial condition.  \n \nThere are generally many months or even years between our initial bid in renewable energy auctions to build \nsolar, wind or other renewable energy projects and the date on which we begin to recognize revenue from the \nsale of electricity generated by such pr ojects. Our initial investments include, legal, accounting and other \nthird -party fees, costs associated with project analysis and feasibility study, payments for land rights, \npayments for interconnection and grid connectivity arrangements, government permi ts, engineering and \nprocurement of solar panels, balance of system costs or other payments, which may be non -refundable. Our \nprojects may not be fully monetized for 25 years given the average length of our PPAs, but we bear the costs \nof our initial investm ent upfront. Furthermore, we have historically relied on our own equity contribution and \nbank loans to pay for costs and expenses incurred during project development. Solar, wind and other \nrenewable energy projects generate revenue only after becoming comm ercially operational and starting to sell \nelectricity to the power grid through offtakers. There may be long delays from winning a bid and entering \ninto a PPA, to obtaining the initial land and interconnection assessments, to the projects becoming \ncommerci ally operational, due to the timing of auctions, financing and construction cycles, receipt of \napprovals and grid connectivity processes. There is no assurance that our success in auctions will necessarily \nlead to execution of corresponding PPAs promptly, or at all.  \n \nBetween our initial investment in the development of solar wind and other renewable energy projects and \ntheir connection to the transmission grid, there may be adverse developments, such as unfavourable \nenvironmental or geological conditions, pandemics, labour strikes, panel shortages or monsoon weather. \nFurthermore, we may not be able to obtain all the permits as anticipated and permits that were obtained may \nexpire or become ineffective, any of which may delay construction or commercial operation. In addition, we \nmay not be able to obtain project level financing as anticipated, which may delay or halt construction of a \nparticular project. Any such delays could materiall y and adversely affect our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition and cash flows.  \n \n17. We operate in a competitive industry and as such may not be able to acquire rights to develop and generate \npower from new solar projects through the competitive bidding process.   \n \n As of September 30, 2024, our \u201cPortfolio\u201d consisted of 16,896 MWs including 3,320  MWs of operating \nprojects and 13,576  MWs of contracted and awarded projects.  Our strategy is to continue to grow our project \npipeline in part through prudent bidding for new projects that come up for tender. We acquire the rights to \ndevelop and generate power from new projects through a competitive bidding process, in which we compete \nfor project awards based primarily on pricing, technical and engineering expertise, financi al conditions, \nincluding specified minimum net worth criteria, financing capabilities and track record. We only submit bids \nfor those renewable energy auctions where we are comfortable with the policies, incentives, credit history of \nthe off -taker, and evacuation infrastructure availability, transmission systems, water, roads and \ncommunications networks and other ancillary infrastructure, competitive intensity, capacity on offer and \nrestrictions on maximum/minimum bid quantity. However, it is difficult to p redict whether and when we will \nbe awarded a new renewable power project.  \n \nThe table below sets forth information about our bids/tenders in solar and wind power projects by Central \nand State governments and agencies for the periods indicated.  \n    \n50 \n Particulars  Six months \nperiod ended \nSeptember 30, \n2024  Fiscal  2024  Fiscal  2023(2)  Fiscal  2022 \n(2) \nCapacity  of bids auctioned   \n(in MW)(1) N/A 49,000  12,000  18,000  \nCapacity  of bids participated  in  \n(in MW)  6,350  21,325  5,250  10,735  \nQuoted Capacity (in MW)  1,770  8,900  2,255  6,090  \nCapacity for which our bids/tenders \nwon (in MW)  400 3,455  1,190  3,265  \nPercentage  of bids won against  \ncapacity  of total bids quoted (Bid \nSuccess Ratio)  22.60%  38.82%  52.77%  53.61%  \n(1) Solar and wind projects auctioned by central and state governments in the period.  (Source: CRISIL Report, November  2024)  \n(2) Our Company was incorporated on April 7, 2022, and, in Fiscal 2023, we had only 31 days of operation from February 28, 2023 \nafter assets were transferred from NTPC Limited to our Company.  Bids/tenders made in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 were made \nby the N TPC Group.  \n \nIn addition, the government conducted tender processes may be subject to change in qualification criteria, \nunexpected delays and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the projects for which we bid will be \ntendered within a reasonable time, or at all. In the event that new projects which have been announced and \nwhich we plan to bid for are not put up for  tender within the announced timeframe, or qualification criteria \nare modified such that we are unable to qualify, our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and \nresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  \nThe bidding processes are also affected by factors which may be beyond our control, such as market \nconditions or government incentive programs. If we misjudge our competitiveness when submitting our bids \nor if we fail to lower our costs to submit competiti ve bids, we may not acquire the rights on new renewable \nenergy projects. Also, our competitors may also have a competitive advantage or a greater willingness or \nability to win the bids with little or no operating margins for sustained periods of time which  may affect our \nproject pipeline for growth. Furthermore, we make assumptions with respect to prices for system components \nand raw materials, and if prices for system components and raw materials are greater than our assumed prices, \nour project economics m ay be adversely affected and the project for which we won through bidding may not \nremain economically viable.  \n18. Our Corporate Promoter, NTPC Limited has, in the five years preceding the date of this Prospectus, faced \nregulatory actions by regulators and had certain fines levied on it. Any further non -compliance by our \nCorporate Promoter of the SEBI Listing Regulations or any other regulations applicable to it in the future, \nmay adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.  \n \nOur Corporate Promoter, NTPC Limited (\u201c NTPC \u201d), a listed company, is subject to regulatory oversight from \nSEBI and the Stock Exchanges and is consequently required to comply with various applicable rules and \nregulations in terms of its listed equity shares, including the SEBI Listing Regulations, which requires it to \ninter alia adhere to certain corporate governance norms on board composition, disclose its quarterly financial \nresults, subject to a limited review, within a stipulated period from the end of the quarter, etc.  \nDue to certain instances of non -compliance, our Corporate Promoter has, in the five years preceding the date \nof this Prospectus, faced regulatory actions by regulators and had certain fines levied on it, the details of \nwhich are set out below:  \n1. Since Q1 2020, NTPC has received notices from NSE & BSE imposing fine amounting to \u20b9 11.41  million \n(including GST) each respectively, in respect of non -compliance of Regulations 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of \nSEBI Listing Regulations due to non -availability of adequate numbers of independent directors on the Board \nof the Company. As directors of NTPC  are appointed by the Government of India, NTPC has requested stock \nexchanges to waive the fine. BSE had waived the fine of \u20b9 0.54 million of Q1 2020 imposed due to  non-\ncompliance of Regulation 17 of SEBI Listing Regulations. In addition to above, NSE & BSE had imposed    \n51 \n fine of \u20b911,800/ - each respectively in respect of non -compliance of Regulation 29 of SEBI Listing \nRegulations. Fine of \u20b911,800/ - was paid to NSE, however, request for waiver is pending with BSE.  \n2. NSE had imposed fine of \u20b970,000/ - under Para. 8.4 of Chapter XVII of SEBI operational circular for \ndelay in certificate of confirming fulfilment of payment obligation. However, penalty was waived vide NSE\u2019s \nletter dated June 19, 2023.  \n3. In addition to above, demat account of NTPC Limited was frozen by stock exchanges, in September \n2022 due to noncompliance of provisions of SEBI Listing Regulations by PTC (India) Limited.  \nWhile the stock exchanges have not taken any further action against NTPC regarding the matters mentioned \nabove \u2014beyond the imposition of a fine and temporary suspension of trading accounts \u2014there is no assurance \nthat NTPC will not face stricter and more stri ngent penal action in the future for any non -compliance with, \nor failure to adhere to , the relevant rules and regulations.  \nImposition of strict penal proceedings against our Corporate Promoter may have an adverse effect on our \nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  \n \n19. The regulatory and policy environment affecting the renewable energy sector in India impacts our \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and may become more stringent in the future.   \n  \nThe regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and subject to periodic change, and \nour business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by any \nunfavourable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, or implementation of new laws. Uncertainty in \nthe applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change in, governing law, \nregulation or policy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including by reason of an a bsence, or a limited \nbody, of administrative or judicial precedent may be time consuming as well as costly for us to resolve and \nmay impact the viability of our business currently or in the future.  \nOur business, results of operation and financial performance could be adversely affected by any change in \nlaws or interpretation of existing, or the promulgation of, laws, rules and regulations applicable to us. There \ncan be no assurance that the GoI will not implement new regulations and policies which will require us to \nobtain additional approvals and licenses from the government and other regulatory bodies or impose onerous \nrequirements and conditions on our operations, which could result in increased co mpliance costs as well as \ndivert significant management time and other resources.  \nChanges to government policies curtailing renewable energy generation may adversely affect our business. If \ngovernmental authorities stop supporting, or reduce or eliminate their support for, the development of \nrenewable energy projects, it may become more  difficult to obtain financing, our economic return on certain \nprojects may be reduced and its financing costs may increase. A delay or failure by governmental authorities \nto administer incentive programs in a timely and efficient manner could also adverse ly affect our ability to \nobtain financing for its projects. These may, in turn, materially and adversely affect business, results of \noperations, financial condition and cash flows.  \n20. We do not own our Registered and Corporate Office. A failure to renew our existing lease arrangements at \ncommercially favourable terms or at all may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations.  \nWe do not own our registered office is located at NTPC Bhawan , Core -7, SCOPE Complex 7 Institutional \nArea, Lodi Road, New Delhi -110 003, Delhi, India or our corporate office is located at NTPC Renewables \nComplex E -3, Ecotech -II, Udyog Vihar, Gautam Buddha Naga r, Uttar Pradesh, 201306 India. Our corporate \noffice is on lease for a term of two years until March 31, 2025. We cannot assure you that we will be able to \nrenew our leases on commercially acceptable terms or at all. While we have not failed to renew our l ease \narrangements in the past, in the event that we are unable to in the future, we may be required to vacate our \ncurrent premises and make alternative arrangements for new offices. We cannot assure that the new \narrangements will be on commercially accepta ble terms. If we are required to relocate our offices, we may \nsuffer a disruption in our operations or have to pay increased charges, which could have an adverse effect on \nour business, results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the deeds f or our existing and future \nleased properties may not be adequately stamped or such stamp duty may not be accepted as evidence in a \ncourt of law and we may be required to pay penalties for inadequate stamp duty.  \n    \n52 \n 21. Certain unsecured loans have been availed by us which may be recalled by lenders.   \n \nAs of September 30, 2024, we had availed unsecured loans aggregating to \u20b9 145,254.61 million, from banks \nand financial institutions.  \n \nWe availed unsecured loans and borrowings from time to time from banks and financial institutions.  The \nfollowing table sets forth our unsecured debt position as at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2023, as per \nthe Restated Consolidated Financial Information, and as at March 31, 2023 and 2022 , on a carved -out basis, \nas per the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements.   \n \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated Financial \nInformation (1) Special Purpose Carved -Out \nCombined Financial Statements (2) \nAs at  \nSeptember 30, \n2024  As at  \nMarch 31, 2024  As at  \nMarch 31, 2023  As at  \nMarch 31, 2022  \nNon-Current Unsecured Borrowings  \n(\\\u20b9 in millions)  139,047.71  105,567.07  50,931.90  71,582.89  \n- Non-Current Unsecured Borrowings \nas percentage of total borrowings (%)  81.52%  82.50%  94.01%  83.03%  \nCurrent Unsecured Borrowings  \n(\u20b9 in millions)  6,206.90  6,206.90        1,743.10           360.14  \nCurrent Unsecured Borrowings as \npercentage of total borrowings (%)  3.64%  4.85%  3.22%  0.42%  \nNotes:  \n(1) Based on the Restated Consolidated Financial Information for Fiscal 2024 and the six months period ended September  30, 2024. \nSee \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information\u201d on page 282. \n(2) Based on the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, which have been \nprepared on a carved -out basis from the audited consolidated financial statements of the NTPC Group for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal \n2022 and o ur Restated Consolidated Financial Information for Fiscal 2023. This carved -out financial information is not financial \ninformation of our Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and associates under the leadership of our current management an d \nboard.

See also \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Our Special \nPurpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements and Carved -out Operating Data may not be representative of our results as \nan independent company\u201d on page 38. \n \nAny failure to service such indebtedness, or otherwise perform any obligations under such financing \nagreements may lead to acceleration of payments under such credit facilities. In the event that the lenders \nseek repayment of such unsecured loans, we would  need to find alternative sources of financing, which may \nnot be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, any such demand may materially \nand adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations . For further \ninformation, see \u201c Financial Indebtedness \u201d on page 516, \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information \u2013 Note \n15 \u2013 Non-current financial liabilities -Borrowings \u201d on page 328 and \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial \nInformation \u2013 Note 19 \u2013 Current financial liabilities - Borrowings \u201d on page 404.  \n \n22. Due to our substantial indebtedness, volatility in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of \noperations, financial condition and cash flows.   \nAs of September  30, 2024, \u20b9170,574.96 million (100%)  of our borrowings had floating rates of interest.  \nAccordingly, volatility in interest rates affects the cost of these borrowings. An increase or decrease in interest \nrates will increase or decrease our interest expense associated with such borrowing.  \n  \nIn periods of volatile interest rates, we seek to finance our projects on a long -term basis with debt matched to \ncash flows. Such debt could have significant consequences on our operations, including:  \n   \n\u25cf reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and \nother general corporate purposes as a result of our debt service obligations;  \n \n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;  \n \n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we \noperate and the general economy;     \n53 \n  \n\u25cf potentially affecting our credit rating;  \n \n\u25cf potentially increasing the cost of any additional financing; and  \n \n\u25cf limiting the ability of our project operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to us for working capital or \nreturn on our investment.  \nAny of these factors and other consequences that may result from our substantial indebtedness could \nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows impacting our ability \nto meet our payment obligations under our deb t. Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our \noutstanding debt depends on our ability to generate adequate cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is \nsubject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors \nthat are beyond our control.  \n  \nWe are affected by volatility in interest rates in our borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many \nfactors beyond our control, including the monetary policies of the RBI and other central banks, deregulation \nof the financial sector in India, do mestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors. \nFurthermore, the rise in inflation and consequent fluctuation in interest rates, repo rates (the rates at which \nthe RBI lends to commercial banks) may also be important factors a ffecting interest rates. A significant \nincrease in interest expense could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and \ncash flows impacting our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt . \n \n23. All our employees are on secondment from our parent company, NTPC Limited, the terms of which may \nbe altered at any time. We may be subject to industrial unrest and increased employee costs, which may \nadversely affect our business and results of operations .  \n \nAs of September 30, 2024, our workforce comprised 232 employees, and we utilised the services of 45 \ncontract labourers.  Except for our Executive Directors, all Key Managerial Personnel, Senior Management \nand all  our employees are on secondment from our parent company, NTPC Limited ., There is no secondment \nagreement between the Company and NTPC Limited.  The secondments are pursuant to office orders  and the \nterms of which may be altered at any time.  \n \nPay allowances, perquisites and other benefits of the employees are governed by the terms and conditions as \nper the policy of NTPC Limited.  Our employee benefits expense comprise payments made to all the personnel \non our payroll and engaged in our operations (apart from contract labour). However, the remuneration to \nseconded employees is paid by our Company.  The following tables set forth our employee benefit expenses \nin the periods indicated.  \n \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated \nFinancial Information \n(1) Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined \nFinancial Statements (2) \n \n \nFiscal 2024   \nFiscal 2023  \n  \nFiscal 2022  \n \n\u20b9 million  As a % of \nexpenses  \u20b9 million  As a % of \nexpenses  \u20b9 million  As a % of \nexpenses  \nEmployee benefit expenses net off \nexpenditure during construction  370.14  2.39%  129.10  1.21%  76.80  1.18%  \n \n \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated Financial Information (1) \n \nSix months period ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024   \nSix months period ended  \nSeptember 30, 2023  \n\u20b9 million  As a % of \nexpenses  \u20b9 million  As a % of \nexpenses  \nEmployee benefit expenses net off expenditure \nduring construction  306.60  3.46%  159.16  2.15%  \n \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for \nFiscal 2024.

For our Restated Consolidated Financial \ninformation for Fiscal 2023, see \u201cSummary Financial Information\u201d on page 96 and \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial \nInformation\u201d on page 282.    \n54 \n (2) Based on Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, which includes the \ncarved -out business in respect of RE Assets (part of the standalone financial statements of NTPC Limited until February 28, \n2023) which ha s been combined with the standalone financial statements of NREL for the year ended March 31, 2022 and our \nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023.  This carved -out financial information is not our financial \ninformation under th e leadership of our current management and board.  See \u201cSpecial Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements\u201d on page 365. See also \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements and \nCarved -out Operating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent company\u201d on page 38. \n \nOur operations are significantly dependent on the cooperation and continued support of our workforce. As of \nthe date of this RHP, we do not have any employee unions. Strikes or work stoppages by our workforce at our \nprojects could halt our production which could impact our ability to deliver electricity t o our offtaker customer \nin a timely manner or at all, which could adversely affect the results of our operations and reputation. There have \nbeen no disruptions to our operations in the six months period ended September 30, 2024, and in Fiscal 2024, \nFiscal 2023 or Fiscal 2022, on account of labour -related disputes including strikes, lockouts, or collective \nbargaining arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that we will not experience work disruptions in \nthe future due to disputes or other problems w ith our workforce. Any such event, at our current facilities or at \nany new facilities that we may commission in the future, may adversely affect our ability to operate our business \nand serve our customers, and impair our relationships with certain key cust omers, which may adversely impact \nour business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \n24. Our business is seasonal and our operating results may fluctuate from period to period, which could make \nour future performance difficult to predict and could cause our operating results for a particular period to \nfall below expectations.   \n  \nOur quarterly and half -yearly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the \nfuture. The energy output performance of our solar projects is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight \nand the ambient temperatures. As a re sult, our revenue in the past has been impacted by rain and sunlight. \nOur solar energy output decreases in monsoon seasons due to less sunlight whereas it increases during winter \nand summer months.  \n \nThe energy output performance of our wind projects is dependent on wind patterns and wind speeds. As a \nresult, our revenue in the past has been impacted by wind speeds. Our wind energy output decreases during \nthe \u201cLow Wind Season\u201d, which generally spans Oc tober to March, and increases during the \u201cHigh Wind \nSeason\u201d, which generally spans April to September in any given year.  \n \nWe believe that the higher levels of revenue generated during the winter and summer months and High Wind \nSeason can help to mitigate the lower levels of revenue generated during the monsoon seasons and Low Wind \nSeason. Typically, our revenue is the lowest from June to September and highest from January to March of \nany given fiscal year.  \n \nWe have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past, and we may experience similar \nfluctuations in the future. However, given that the renewable energy industry is growing rapidly, those \nfluctuations may be masked by our recent growth rates  and thus may not be readily apparent from our \nhistorical operating results. As such, our quarterly operating results may not be good indicators of future \nperformance.  \n  \nIn addition to the other risks described in this \u201c Risk Factors \u201d section, the following factors could cause our \noperating results to fluctuate:  \n  \n \n\u25cf the expiration or initiation of any central or state subsidies or incentives;  \n \n\u25cf our ability to complete installations in a timely manner due to market conditions or due to unavailable \nfinancing;  \n \n\u25cf our ability to continue to expand our operations, and the amount and timing of expenditures related to \nsuch expansions;  \n \n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures \nor capital -raising activities or commitments;     \n55 \n  \n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies or terms or those of our competitors;  \n \n\u25cf actual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape;  \n \n\u25cf an occurrence of low global horizontal irradiation that affects our generation of solar power;  \nan occurrence of low wind speeds for extended periods of time affecting the wind generation  \n \n\u25cf fluctuations due to the pandemics and resulting operational disruptions;  \n \n\u25cf change in law or adoption of new accounting pronouncements;  \n \n\u25cf significant volatility in market conditions (including, but not limited to foreign currency rates, interest \nrates and our share price); and  \n \u25cf fluctuations in the electricity pricing  \nFor these or other reasons, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as \nindications of our future performance. In addition, with respect to the above factors our actual revenue, key \noperating and financial metrics and other operating results in future quarters may fall short of the expectations \nof investors and financial analysts, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our \nshares.  \n25. Any downgrade of our credit ratings or NTPC Limited\u2019s credit ratings could adversely affect our business.  \n \nAs of the date of this Prospectus, we have received the following credit ratings on our debt and credit facilities.   \nInstrument or Rating Type  \u20b9 million  Date  Ratings  \nTotal Bank Loan Facilities Rated  100,000.00  May 6, 2024  CRISIL AAA/Stable            \n(Long Term)  \nCRISIL A1+  (Short Term)  \nTotal Bank Loan Facilities Rated  200,000.00  May 31, 2024  IND AAA/Stable                    \n(Long Term)  \nIND A1+  (Short Term)  \n \nThese ratings assess our overall financial capacity to pay our obligations and are reflective of our ability to \nmeet financial commitments as they become due. Further, there can be no assurance that these ratings will \nnot be revised or changed by the above rating agencies due to various factors. Any downgrade in our credit \nratings may in crease interest rates for refinancing our outstanding debt, which would increase our financing \ncosts, and adversely affect our future issuances of debt and our ability to raise new capital on a competitive \nbasis.  \nFurther, the credit rating of our Corporate Promoter, NTPC Limited, is often a benchmark used to assess our \noverall credit when borrowing or issuing debt securities.  Any downgrade in the credit ratings of NTPC \nLimited may increase interest rates for refin ancing our outstanding debt, which would increase our financing \ncosts, and adversely affect our future issuances of debt and our ability to raise new capital on a competitive \nbasis.  \n26. The generation of electricity from solar and wind sources (including our capacity utilization \nfactor)depends heavily on suitable meteorological and climate conditions. Unfavourable weather \nconditions could have a significant impact on our business prospect s and future financial performance. \nFurther, the physical conditions surrounding the wind turbine generators and solar farms may interfere \nwith the operational performance of these assets.  \n  \nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by our renewable energy projects are highly dependent on \nweather conditions and air pollution, which are beyond our control. Furthermore, components of our systems, \nsuch as solar panels and inverters, could b e damaged by severe weather. We generally will be obligated to bear \nthe expense of repairing the damaged solar energy systems that we own, subject to insurance policies in effect, \nand replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costl y to acquire or may be unavailable. \nUnfavourable weather, high levels of air pollution and atmospheric conditions could impair the effectiveness of \nour assets or reduce their output beneath their rated capacity or require shutdown of key equipment, impedin g \noperation of our assets and our ability to achieve certain performance guarantees pursuant to our PPAs,    \n56 \n forecasted revenues and cash flows. Sustained unfavourable weather could also unexpectedly delay the \ninstallation of renewable energy systems, which could result in a delay in us acquiring new projects or increase \nthe cost of such projects. Most of our PPA s obligate a minimum generation and could suffer monetary \nconsequences if our plants do not produce to our contracted levels.  \n \nWe regularly measure the performance of our plants by using the industry measure, generation/capacity \nutilization factor (\u201c CUF \u201d).  The CUF is lower in solar power plants as compared to thermal power plants \ngiven the nature of operations (availability when the sun is shining, or wind is turning turbines). Our CUF \nhas generally been on par with our peer group competitors although s lightly lower.  For a comparison of our \nCUF and generation to our peers, see \u201c Industry Overview - Landscape of leading project dev elopers \u201d on page \n189. The following table sets forth our CUF for our operating renewable energy plants for the periods \nindicated.  \n \nParticulars  Company Operating Data  Carved -out Operating Data \n(1) \nSix months \nperiod \nended \nSeptember \n30, 2024  Six months \nperiod \nended \nSeptember \n30, 2023  Fiscal 2024  Fiscal 2023  Fiscal 2022  \nCapacity utilization factor(2) (%)      \n   Solar  24.61%  25.04% 23.97%  22.74%  19.21%  \n   Wind (3) 28.27 % 30.14% 19.78%  23.58%  23.66%  \n   Total  24.73% 25.13% 23.86%  22.76%  19.40%  \n(1) Our Carved -out Operating Data is based on the carved -out consolidated operating data pertaining to RE Assets of NTPC Limited, \nNREL and our Company for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.  This Carved -out Operating Data is not our operating data under the \nleadership o f our current management and board.  See \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements and Carved -out Operating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent company \u201d on page 38. \n(2) Capacity utilization refers to the weighted average of CUF of installed capacity in the portfolio as on given date.  \n(3) Wind CUF is lower in Fiscal 2024 mainly due to the commissioning of the new Dayapar wind project during the low wind season.  \n \nWe base our investment decisions with respect to each solar or wind project on the findings of related solar and \nwind studies based on some site data and historical date of the locations prior to construction. However, actual \nclimatic conditions at a proje ct site may not conform to the findings of these studies and therefore, our facilities \nmay not meet anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of our generation assets, which could adversely \naffect our business, results of operations, financial co ndition and cash flows.  \n \nThe operational performance of our wind farms depends on wind speeds which can be impacted by the physical \nconditions at the relevant site. Objects such as large buildings or other wind turbine generators near our wind \nfarms, may reduce our wind resources due to the disruption of wind flows, known as \u201cwake effects\u201d. Typically, \nthe land under a wind turbine generator tower is acquired or leased in connection with the development of a \nwind farm by a power producer. Currently, there are regulatory requirements  with respect to the positioning of \nthe turbines to minimize such wake -effects and maximize output. However, in case such regulatory requirements \nare lifted or relaxed, new wind turbine generators from our competitors or certain other structures may be \ninstalled by third parties near our wind farms, which could have a negative effect on our wind farms. While we \nmake provisions for such external wake effects in our energy forecasts for our wind farms, our estimated \nprovisions may be lower than the actual wak e effect, and we may be unable to achieve certain performance \nthresholds pursuant to our PPAs, forecasted revenues and cash flows.  \n \nSimilarly, external physical conditions near our solar farms such as shadows cast by nearby buildings or trees, \nor additional dust resulting from nearby construction work or forestry or plantations works, could cause a \nreduction in the efficiency of our so lar farms, and we may be unable to achieve certain performance thresholds \npursuant to our PPAs, forecasted revenues and cash flows.  \n \nA sustained decline in environmental and other conditions at our solar or wind projects could materially and \nadversely decrease the volume of electricity generated and could also impact market demand for solar and wind \nprojects. As a consequence, our busin ess, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be \nmaterially and adversely affected.  \n \n27. Our Company is not in compliance with certain provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations and the SEBI \nICDR Regulations.     \n57 \n  \nFor the purposes of undertaking the present Issue and post the listing of the equity shares, our Company is \nrequired to comply with Regulation 17 (1) of the SEBI Listing Regulations which provides that a listed \ncompany should have an optimum combination of executive and non-executive  directors with at least one \nwoman director and not less than fifty per cent of the board of directors shall comprise of non -executive \ndirectors . One of our Promoters, NTPC Limited, vide their request letter dated June 3, 2024 a nd July 4, 2024, \nhad intimated the GoI, requesting for the appointment of chairman and managing director, functional \ndirectors and independent directors on the Board of our Company. The Ministry of Power, Go vernment of \nIndia , vide their letter dated August 28, 2024,  approved the composition the Board of the Company, \ncomprising of Gurdeep Singh, Jaikumar Srinivasan and Shanmugha Sundaram Kothand apani, who hold \nadditional charge of the posts of Chairman and Managing Director, Director (Finance) and Director \n(Projects), respectively, as the Executive Directors.  Additionally, our Company received the office order \nfrom the Ministry of Power, Go vernment of India , dated November 4, 2024, confirming the appointment of \nDr. Viveka Nand Paswan, Bimal Chand Oswal and Sajal Jha as the non -official independent directors on the \nboard of our Company and as on the date of this Prospectus, the board composition of our Company is in \ncompliance with the SEBI Listing Regulations. However, the appointments in relation to the afore said non -\nofficial independent directors on the board of our Company is on a temporary basis, till the next annual \ngeneral meeting of the Company or any such period as may be decided by the Ministry of Power, GoI. One \nof our Promoters, NTPC Limited, vide their correspondence dated August 27, 2024, had intimated the \nMinistry of Power, GoI, that under Regulation 24 of the SEBI Listing Regulations, our material subsidiary, \nnamely, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited, would require at least one independent director  who is on the \nboard of the Company, to be one of the directors on the board of the unlisted material subsidiary. \nSubsequently, vide office order dated November 4, 2024, the Ministry of Power, GoI, has appointed Dr. \nViveka Nand Paswan as a non -official independent director on the board of our Material  Subsidiary. In view \nof the above, exemption had been sought from the requirement of Clause (10)(f)(g) of Part A of Schedule \nVI (10) (F) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, Regulations 17 (1), 18 (3), 19 (4)24 (1) of t he SEBI Listing \nRegulations . Additionally, in accordance with the MCA notification, dated June 5, 2015, the DPE Guidelines \non Corporate Governance for Central Public Sector Enterprises, matters pertaining to the appointment, and \nremuneration of our Directors and performance evaluati on of our Directors are determined by the President \nof India acting through the Ministry of Power, GoI. Further, our Statutory Auditors are appointed by the \nComptroller and Auditor General of India. As a CPSE, our Company is gove rned by the corporate \ngovernance guidelines of the DPE Guidelines on Corporate Governance for Central Public Sector Enterprises \n(\u201cDPE Guidelines \u201d). In accordance with the DPE Guidelines and as specifically provided under the Articles \nof association of our Company, the directors of our Company are appointed by the GoI  and their terms of \nappointment (including their remuneration) are also approved by the GoI. Accordingly, in so far as the above -\nmentioned matters are concerned, the terms of reference of our No mination and Remuneration Committee \nand Audit Committee only allow these committees to take on record the actions of the President of India or \nthe Comptroller and Auditor General of India, as the case may be. Further, the Nomination and Remuneration \nCommit tee neither has the power to formulate any criteria/policy to determine qualifications, positive \nattributes, independence, or remuneration of the directors nor does it have power to formulate criteria for \nevaluation of performance of our Directors. To this  extent, the terms of reference of the Nomination and \nRemuneration Committee and the Audit Committee are precluded from being consistent with the role of a \nnomination and remuneration committee and an audit committee under the SEBI Listing Regulations. \nAdditionally, as on the date of this Prospectus, our Company is in conformity with the composition of the \nAudit Committee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Stakeholders Relationship Committee, Risk \nManagement Committee and Corporate Social Responsibilit y Committee  (the \u201c Committees ) applicable for \na listed entity under the Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI Listing Regulations and the prescribed corporate \ngovernance norms.    \n \nAccordingly, in relation to the above matters, our Company, had filed an exemption letter dated September \n18, 2024 under Regulation 300(1) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and Regulation 102 of the SEBI Listing \nRegulations s eeking certain  exemptions from : (i) compliance with regulation 17 (1) of the SEBI Listing \nRegulations in relation to the appointment of independent directors; (ii) compliance with regulation 24 (1) \nof the SEBI Listing Regulations which provides that a listed company should have at least one  independent \ndirector who is on the board of the listed company, to be one of the directors on the board of its unlisted \nmaterial subsidiary; (iii) compliance with  certain  corporate  governance  requirements  in  relation  to  the  \nterms  of  reference  of  the Nomination  and Remuneration Committee as specified under Regulation 19(4) \nread with Schedule II \u2013Part D of the SEBI Listing Regulatio ns and the Audit Committee as specified under \nRegulation 18(3) read with point (2) of para (A) under Schedule  II -Part  C of  the SEBI  Listing  Regulation; \nand (iv)  clause (1) (b), Schedule XVI of the SEBI ICDR Regulations which states that any change in more    \n58 \n than half of the board of directors after filing of the DRHP,  may require filing a fresh draft offer document \nwith SEBI .  SEBI, vide its letter bearing reference number SEBI/CFD/RAC -DIL1/2024/32978 dated October \n21, 2024, has granted our Company an exemption from compliances of the aforementioned corporate \ngovernance requirements as prescribed under the SEBI Listing Regulations, until listing of the Equity Shares \nof our Company. The exemptions sought by our Company under the SEBI Listing Regulations are gr anted \nonly till the listing of our Equity Shares, and subsequent to listing, our Company is required to comply with \nthe applicable provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations. For further information, see \u201c Issue Document \nSummary \u2013 Exemption from complying with any  provisions of securities laws, if any, granted by SEBI \u201d on \npage 30. \n \n \n28. Our funding requirements and the proposed deployment of Net Proceeds have not been appraised by any \nbank or financial institution or any other independent agency and our management will have broad \ndiscretion over the use of the Net Proceeds.  \n \nWe intend to utilize the Net Proceeds of the Issue as set forth in \u201cObjects of the Issue\u201d beginning on page \n124. The funding requirements mentioned as a part of the objects of the Issue are based on internal \nmanagement estimates and our current business plans, and have not been appraised by any bank or financial \ninstitution. This is based on current conditions and is subject to change in light of changes in external \ncircumstances, costs, business initiatives, other financial conditions or business strategie s. While we will use \nthe Net Proceeds towards repayment/prepayment, in full or in part, of certain outstanding borrowings availed \nby our Subsidiary, NREL, and towards general corporate purposes, the amount of Net Proceeds to be used \nwill be based on our manag ement\u2019s discretion. Various risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in \nthis section, may limit or delay our efforts to use the Net Proceeds to achieve profitable growth in our \nbusiness. Our internal management estimates may exceed fair market  value or the value that would have been \ndetermined by third party appraisals and as a consequence, we may be required to reschedule or reallocate \nour capital expenditures which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash \nflows.  \nThe deployment of the Net Proceeds will be at the discretion of our Board.  \nFurther, we propose to repay or pre -pay certain loans obtained from HDFC Bank Limited, one of the Book \nRunning Lead Managers appointed in connection with the Issue from the Net Proceeds. However, on account \nof this relationship, HDFC Bank Limited does not qualify as an associate of our Company in terms of in \nterms of Regulation 21(A)(1) of the SEBI Merchant Bankers Regulations read with Regulation 23(3) of the \nSEBI ICDR Regulations since the rupee term loan was provided by HDFC Bank Limited to our Material \nSubsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited as part of their ordinary course of lending business.  \nAccordingly, we do not believe that there is any conflict of interest in terms of the SEBI Merchant Banking \nRegulations, as amended or any other applicable law  \nFurther, we will appoint a Monitoring Agency for monitoring the utilisation of Issue Proceeds in accordance \nwith Regulation 41 of the SEBI ICDR Regulations and the Monitoring Agency will submit its report to us on \na quarterly basis in accordance with the S EBI ICDR Regulations. We may have to reconsider our estimates \nor business plans due to changes in underlying factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as interest \nrate fluctuations, changes in input cost, and other financial and operational facto rs. \n29. We have substantial capital expenditure requirements and may require additional financing to meet those \nrequirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nOur renewable energy business is capital intensive as we require adequate capital to develop new projects and \nexpand into new business like green hydrogen, green chemicals and energy storage systems. Our historical \ncapital expenditure has been and is expec ted to be primarily used towards development and enhancement of \nproduction capacities by way of setting up multi product plant facilities. In some of the initial projects, we \nhave funded our capital expenditure requirements primarily through external borro wings at the project level \nand other borrowings.  \n \nThe table below sets forth our capital expenditure for the periods indicated.  \n \n    \n59 \n  \n \n \n \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated Financial Information (1) Special Purpose Carved -Out \nCombined Financial Statements \n(2) \nSix months \nperiod ended \nSeptember 30,  \n2024  Six months \nperiod ended \nSeptember 30,  \n2023  Fiscal 2024  Fiscal 2023  Fiscal 2022  \nCapital Expenditure       \n(\u20b9 million)  38,998.34  8,953.33   88,827.19   30,596.89   49,666.66  \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for \nFiscal 2024.

See also \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements and Carved -out \nOperating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent company\u201d on page 38. \n \nAs part of our strategy, we intend to expand our renewable energy business. There can be no assurance that \nour expansion plans will be implemented as planned or on schedule, or that we will achieve our increased \nplanned output capacity or operational effic iency. Although we have generally not experienced time or cost \noverruns in the past, if in the future we experience significant delays or mishaps in the implementation of the \nexpansion plans or if there are significant cost overruns, then the overall benef it of such plans to our revenues \nand profitability may decline. To the extent that the planned expansion does not produce anticipated or desired \noutput, revenue or cost -reduction outcomes, our business, results of operations and financial condition would \nbe adversely affected.  \n \nOur sources of additional financing, where required to meet our capital expenditure plans or working capital \nrequirements, may include the incurrence of debt or the issue of equity or debt securities or a combination of \nboth. If we decide to raise additional funds through the incur rence of debt, our interest and debt repayment \nobligations will increase, and could have a significant effect on our profitability and cash flows and we may be \nsubject to additional covenants, which could limit our ability to access cash flows from operati ons. Any issuance \nof equity, on the other hand, would result in a dilution of your shareholding.  For details in relation to the terms \nof our existing financing arrangements, see \u201c Financial Indebtedness \u201d on page 516. \n \nOur ability to obtain external financing is subject to several uncertainties, including:  \n   \n\u25cf our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;  \n \n\u25cf the credit history of NTPC Limited and its credit ratings;  \n \n\u25cf our past credit history and credit ratings;  \n \n\u25cf the prevailing exchange rate of Indian rupee against major currencies, in particular, the U.S. dollar;  \n \n\u25cf the continued confidence of banks, financial institutions and debt capital investors in us and the \nrenewable energy industry in India;  \n \n\u25cf the interest rate environment in India and internationally;  \n \n\u25cf the general condition of global equity and debt capital markets;  \n \n\u25cf economic, political and other conditions in the jurisdictions where we operate;     \n60 \n  \n\u25cf regulatory and government support in the form of tax incentives, preferential tariffs, project cost \nsubsidies and other incentives; and  \n \n\u25cf our ability to comply with any financial covenants under our debt financing.  \n \nFailure to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and in a timely manner could adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  \n \n30. In the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in  Fiscal 2024, 90.78% and 93.77%, respectively \nof our revenue was from solar energy projects, and 4.65% and 2.40%, respectively, of our revenue from \noperations was from wind energy projects.  The limited operating history of our solar and wind projects \nmay not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects, results of operations and cash flows.  \n \nOur Company was incorporated on April 7, 2022 for the reorganisation of NTPC Limited\u2019s renewable energy \nbusiness. Pursuant to the issuance of NMP by the Ministry of Finance on August 23, 2021, and in consultation \nwith the Ministry of Power, the RE Assets o f NTPC Limited were transferred to our Company at book value, \nthrough a business transfer agreement dated July 8, 2022. Further, NTPC Limited also transferred 100% of its \nequity shareholding held in NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (\u201cNREL\u201d) to our Company thr ough a share \npurchase agreement dated July 8, 2022. The transfer of the RE assets and 100% equity shareholding in NREL, \nwere completed on February 28, 2023 .  \n \nIn the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, 90.78% and 93.77%, respectively, of \nour revenue was from solar energy projects and 4 .65% and 2.40%, respectively, of our revenue from operations \nwas from wind energy projects.   There has been significant upward variation in our revenues from operations  \nduring the six months period ended September 30, 2024  and during Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, \nwhich is primarily attributable to our increase in capacity during these periods . \nThe tables below set out our renewable energy sales for the periods indicated.  \n(\u20b9 in million ) \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated \nFinancial  \nInformation (1) Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements (2) \n \n \n \nFiscal 2024   \n \nFiscal 2023   \n \nFiscal 2022  \n (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue \nfrom \noperations  (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue \nfrom \noperations  (\u20b9 in million ) % Revenue \nfrom \noperations  \nRenewable \nEnergy Sales        \nSolar  18,403.54  93.77%  13,651.81  94.17%  8,447.56  92.79%  \nWind   471.02  2.40%  401.30  2.77%  400.80  4.40%  \nTotal \nRenewable \nEnergy Sales  18,874.56  96.17%  14,053.11  96.94%  8,848.36  97.19%  \nRevenue from \noperations  19,625.98  100.00%  14,497.09  100.00%  9,104.21  100.00%  \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for Fiscal 2024.

See \n\u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information\u201d on page 282.    \n \nAll our solar and wind projects have limited operating histories. For more information on our projects, see \u201c Our \nBusiness - Our Projects\u201d  on page 213. Accordingly, the limited operating histories of our renewable energy \nprojects may not be an adequate basis for evaluating our business prospects and financial performance and make \nit difficult to predict the future results of our operations. In particular,  our future revenues and cash flows may \nvary significantly from our historical results, as our projects generally ramp up after becoming operational. In \nadditio n, the renewable energy industry in India is relatively young and has only seen significant growth over \nthe past decade. Period to period comparisons of our operating results and our results of operations for any period \nshould not be relied upon as an indi cation of our performance for any future period.  \n \n31. Load dispatch centres may order the curtailment of renewable energy operations. Any such curtailment \nmay adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nLoad dispatch centres in India were formed to ensure that there is an integrated power system in each region and \nare responsible for the dispatch of electricity within their region, for monitoring grid operations and providing \ndirections for ensuring grid stability. However, such load dispatch centres may order the curtailment of \nrenewable power generation despite their being accorded \u201cmust -run\u201d status. Although we have not had any past \ninstances, there have been a few instances in the past where renewable  energy producers have been directed to \nscale back operations, and this may occur in the event of extraordinary circumstances such as a fall in demand \ndue to any unexpected change in weather patterns or variations in macroeconomic indicators. The curtailme nt \ncould also be due to grid security constraints such as a result of transmission congestion owing to a mismatch \nbetween generation and transmission capacity.  \nHowever, load dispatch centres may not provide a reason for such curtailment. For example, the Tamil Nadu \nState Load Despatch Centre has, in the past directed certain renewable energy producers in its region to curtail \noperations without providing valid re asons of grid safety or emergency. Even though the Central Electricity \nAuthority has recently introduced mechanisms for the documenting of such instances and announced that it will \ninvestigate such instances of violation of the \u201cmust run\u201d status, there can  be no assurance that state authorities \nwill diligently furnish relevant information to the Central Electricity Authority promptly, that each such \noccurrence will be investigated by the Central Electricity Authority, or that any such investigation will res ult in \na favourable outcome. Though the majority of PPAs have guaranteed offtake provisions and compensation due \nto curtailment on reasons other than grid security, any future curtailment of renewable energy production may \ninterrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition \nand results of operations.  \n \n32. We are subject to credit and performance risk from our suppliers and contractors.  If our suppliers and \ncontractors fail to perform as required under our agreements with them our business, results of operations \nand financial condition may be adversely affe cted.   \n \nWe enter contracts with third -party suppliers of equipment, materials and other goods and services for the \ndevelopment, construction and operation of our projects as well as for other business operations. Our major \nequipment is covered through vendor warra nty ranging from two years for wind turbines, to five to 25 years  for \nsolar modules and inverters. While we maintain a diversified set of vendors, we remain subject to the risk that. \nvendors will not perform their obligations.  Although in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and    \n62 \n in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, we have not had material instances of our vendors failing to \nperform their obligations,  in the future, if  our vendors do not perform their obligations, or if they deliver any \ncomponents that have a manufacturing defect or do not comply with the specified quality standards and technical \nspecifications, it may result in a material breach of the relevant supply agreement. While we may be able to \nmake a claim against the applicable warranty to cover all or a portion  of the expenses or losses associated with \nthe defective product, such claims may not be sufficient to cover all our expenses and losses resulting from the \ndefect. In addition, our suppliers could cease operations and no longer honour their warranties, whi ch would \nleave us to cover the expense and losses associated with the defective products. If our third -party service \nproviders are unable to perform their obligations, including due to bankruptcy, winding up or any injunction, we \nmay incur additional costs  in finding a replacement service provider in a timely manner and could experience \nsignificant delays in performing our related obligations.  \n \nContractors and suppliers in our projects are generally subject to liquidated damages for failures to achieve \ntimely completion or for performance shortfalls. Our operation and maintenance (\u201c O&M \u201d) contractors may fail \nto plan their operational strategy for the complete lifecycle of a given project, which could potentially create \nproblems such as an inability to service wind turbines or solar modules over the project lifecycle, or failure to \nmaint ain the required site infrastructure or adequate resources at project sites. Although th ere have been no \ninstances in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, \nif  our O&M contractors fail to perform as required under O&M agreements, affected projects may experience \ndecreased performance, reduced useful life or shutdowns, any of which may adversely affect our operational \nperformance, financial condition and results of operations. Liquidated damages payable under third -party EPC \nand O&M contracts are generally limit ed to a specified amount or a percentage of the contract price or the annual \nfees payable. As a result, the liquidated damages recovered from defaulting vendors may not be sufficient to \ncover our losses.  \n \n33. Restrictions on solar equipment imports and wind turbine generator imports and other factors affecting \nthe price or availability of solar equipment, may increase our business costs.  \n \nWe import equipment including solar module cells and components of wind turbine generators from China. The \ntable below sets forth our cost of materials, components and equipment purchased from suppliers in India and \noutside India for the periods indicated.  \nParticulars Restated Consolidated Financial Information (1) \nSix months period ended \nSeptember 30, 2024  Fiscal 2024  \n\u20b9 million  % Costs of \nsupplies(3) \u20b9 million  % Costs of \nsupplies(3)  \nIndia (2) 39,144.90  93.25 % 57,421.94  81.87%  \nOutside India      \n\u2026China  2,834.84  6.75% 12,716.94  18.13%  \nTotal Outside India  2,834.84  6.75% 12,716.94  18.13%  \nTotal  41,979.74  100%  70,138.88  100%  \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and for Fiscal 2024. \nSee \u201cRestated Consolidated Financial Information\u201d on page 282. \n(2) EPC contracts may include imported materials, components and equipment but such supplies are included in India as the EPC \ncontractor is responsible for such supplies and suppliers.  \n(3) Cost of Supplies also include installation, transportation etc. as per service agreements.  \n \nAny restrictions or additional duties imposed by the governments of India or China, or of any other exporting \ncountries could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. For example, in March 2021, \nthe GoI imposed customs duties on the import of solar modules and solar cells after March 31, 2022. As a result, \nwe were subject to imposition of customs duties by government authorities for importing solar modules from \nChina. There is no assurance that other such duties will not be levied  in the future. Though such duties \ninstrumented by the GoI are a pass -through, there may be costs, which cannot be passed on to our offtakers and \ncould have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nDuring 2019, the GoI issued a list of approved module suppliers eligible to supply modules to project developers \nselected to develop solar projects through competitive bidding processes. The GoI decided to include open \naccess and net -metering projects also  to source modules only from the approved vendors, effective from October \n1, 2022. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, in a memorandum dated March 10, 2023, stated that \nprojects commissioned by March 31, 2024, will be exempted from the requirement of  procuring solar    \n63 \n photovoltaic modules only from approved module suppliers. As a result of these regulations, our input costs and \ntimeline for commissioning projects may be impacted.  \n \nAny restriction on purchase of materials, components and equipment from outside India could have an adverse \neffect on our ability to deliver products to our customers, and our business, results of operations and financial \ncondition. Further, if there are a ny trade restrictions, sanctions or higher tariffs placed by India on purchases \nmade from other countries or similar restrictions are placed by the exporting country for supply of products to \nIndia, such trade restrictions, sanctions or higher tariffs may significantly impact our sourcing decisions and may \nlead to increased cost of purchase, and shortages of raw materials. Trade restrictions, sanctions or higher tariffs, \nif imposed in future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial \ncondition.   \n \nFurther, measures addressing the use of forced labour in the global solar supply chain by the United States and \nother countries are disrupting global solar supply chains and may impact our operations. The Uyghur Forced \nLabor Prevention Act, in effect in th e United States from June 21, 2022, creates a presumption that imports of \nany goods made either wholly or in part in Xinjiang have been produced with forced labour. That presumption \nis rebuttable if the U.S. Customs and Border Protection determines, based on \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d \nthat the goods in question were not produced \u201cwholly or in part by forced labour,\u201d and submits a report to the \nU.S. Congress setting out its findings. Other jurisdictions have also been enacting similar legislation or ar e in \nthe process of doing so. For instance, Germany\u2019s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act forbidding forced labour in \nsupply chains went into effect on January 1, 2023. The European Union and Australia both have legislative \ninitiatives to ban importation of goo ds produced with forced labour underway, with the European Commission \npublishing a legislative proposal to ban products made with forced labour on September 14, 2022.   \n \nWe are unable to determine whether our solar panel suppliers comply with such norms. If they were found not \nto follow them, we might have to find alternative suppliers on short notice, resulting in construction delays, \ndisruption and higher costs. While we  have developed multiple supply sources, we could still be adversely \naffected by increased costs, negative publicity, or other materially adverse consequences to business. If we are \nnot in compliance with these or other similar export restrictions or other  similar laws and regulations that apply \nto our operations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other materially adverse consequences.  \n34. The operational failure of existing interconnection facilities or transmission facilities or the lack of \nadequate capacity of such interconnection or transmission facilities or evacuation infrastructure may \nadversely affect our ability to deliver electrici ty to our counterparties which may result in lower revenues. \nIn addition, our business, results of operations and financial condition are  exposed to the extent and \nreliability of the Indian power grid and its dispatch regime.  \n \nOur ability to sell electricity is impacted by the availability of, and access to, relevant and adequate evacuation \nand transmission infrastructure required to deliver power to our contractual delivery point and the arrangements \nand facilities for intercon necting our generation projects to the transmission systems, which are owned and \noperated by third parties or state electricity boards. The operational failure of existing interconnection facilities \nor transmission facilities or the lack of adequate capaci ty of such interconnection or transmission facilities or \nevacuation infrastructure may adversely affect our ability to deliver electricity to our counterparties which may \nresult in lower revenues.  \nIn addition, our business, results of operations and financial condition are exposed to the extent and reliability \nof the Indian power grid and its dispatch regime. As a result of grid constraints, such as grid congestion and \nrestrictions on transmission c apacity of the grid, the transmission and dispatch of the full output of our projects \nmay be curtailed. We may have to stop producing electricity during periods when electricity cannot be \ntransmitted for instance, when the transmission grid malfunctions. F urther, in certain cases, the interconnection \napproval to the grid is granted on a temporary basis. If interconnection approvals are not regularized, it may \nresult in lack of evacuation facilities being available for projects. This may affect our ability t o supply the \ncontracted amount of power to the offtaker which may result in lower revenues. Furthermore, if construction of \npower projects in India, particularly in the states and regions that we operate in, outpaces transmission capacity \nof power grids, w e may not be able to transmit all our potential electricity to the power grid and therefore are \ndependent on the availability of the grid infrastructure.  \nWe are responsible for establishing a connection with the grid interconnection from our generating station \nourselves. Hence, we will be exposed to additional costs and risks associated with developing transmission lines \nand other related infrastructure, in cluding the ability to obtain rights of way from landowners for the construction \nof transmission lines up to the grid interconnection point, which may delay or increase the cost of our projects.     \n64 \n Although the GoI has accorded renewable energy \u201cmust -run\u201d status (which means that any renewable power \nthat is generated must always be accepted by the grid), power producers and power procurers are required to \nundertake planned generation and drawing of p ower through grid scheduling mechanism to maintain the safety \nof the power grid. Deviations from the schedule results in payment of deviation charges for shortfall or excess \nin the generation of power to facilitate grid integration and stability of solar a nd wind power generating stations. \nThe deviation settlement mechanism and charges are subject to revisions by the regulator from time to time and \nmay impact our revenue. In some cases, this may curtail our ability to transmit electricity into the power gri d, \nwhich, if we are not otherwise compensated, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of \noperations.  \n35. Technical problems may reduce energy production below our expectations which materially and adversely \nimpact our generating capacity.  \n \nOur generation assets, including transmission lines and facilities that we construct or own, may not continue to \nperform due to equipment failure, wear and tear, latent defects, design error or operator error, early obsolescence \nor force majeure events, am ong other things, which may lead to unexpected maintenance needs, unplanned \noutages or other operational issues and have a material adverse effect on our projects, business, financial \ncondition and results of operations. In addition, spare parts for wind t urbines and solar projects and key pieces \nof electrical equipment may be hard to acquire or may have significant sourcing lead time. Specifically, for wind \nturbines, we utilize the proprietary technology of some of our vendors and any failure by that vendo r in supplying \nthe technology or providing periodic maintenance or upgrade on a timely basis could adversely impact our \noperations. Further, our sources for some significant spare parts and other equipment are located outside of India. \nAlthough we have not  experienced a shortage of solar modules or critical spare parts in in the six months period \nended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, if  there is a shortage of critical \nspare parts or replacement solar modules, we could incur significant delays in returning our facilities to full \noperation. There also may be unforeseen expenses if vendors default on their warranty obligations.  \nAny mechanical failure or shutdown of equipment sourced from third parties could result in us having to shut \ndown the entire project. Such events could materially and adversely impact our generating capacity. If any \nshutdowns continue for extended periods,  this may give rise to contractual penalties or liabilities, loss of off -\ntakers and damage to our reputation. Although we are entitled to be compensated by manufacturers for certain \nequipment failures and defects in certain cases, these arrangements may no t be enough to cover all losses \nsuffered. While manufacturing defects are typically covered under the warranty agreements, we may have to \nbear the costs of repairing the equipment for any damages not foreseeably covered under our supply agreements. \nOur bus iness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected \nif we cannot recover the expense and losses associated with the faulty component from these warranty providers.  \nFurther, we are subject to strict electricity transmission reliability requirements and standards, regular \ninspections and audits by Governmental agencies like the Central Electricity Authority, Factory Inspectorate, \nLabour Inspectorate and our offtaker cu stomers, most of which are central and state government -run utilities.  \nAlthough we have not had any compliance issues in the past, any failure to comply with contractual and \nregulatory standards may lead to penalties or damages under our PPAs and could ne gatively impact our \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \n36. If we do not successfully develop new renewable energy sources or systems like our green hydrogen, green \nchemicals and energy storage systems initiatives in a timely and cost -effective manner, our business, \nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of op erations may be adversely affected.  \n \nAs part of our business strategies, we intend to further diversify our renewable energy project portfolio by \nentering into new renewable areas including green hydrogen, green chemicals and energy storage systems. \nThe development and commercialisation of new areas like green hydrogen, green chemicals and energy \nstorage systems are complex, time -consuming, costly and involves a high degree of business risk. We may \nbe unable to successfully create these new systems or pro jects or encounter unexpected delays in the launch \nof these systems or projects and even if launched as planned, such systems and projects may not perform as \nwe expect.  Green hydrogen is not commercially viable as on the date of this Prospectus ; and there  can make \nno assurance that green hydrogen will be commercially viable in future.  \n \nThe success of our new renewable offerings including green hydrogen, green chemicals and energy storage \nsystems (including Pumped Hydro Storage Project and Battery Energy Storage Systems)  will depend on \nseveral factors, including our ability to adopt and implement the evolving technology for green hydrogen,    \n65 \n green chemicals and energy storage systems, our ability to properly anticipate customer needs; obtain timely \nregulatory approvals; establish collaborations with suppliers and customers; development, construction and \noperation of such new systems or project s in a timely and cost -effective manner through our efforts; and \nsuccessfully marketing and sales activities. Further, the development of projects is dependent on the market \nacceptability of the products.  In addition, the development and commercialisation  of such new renewable \nofferings is characterised by significant upfront costs, including costs associated with R&D, development \nactivities, obtaining regulatory approvals and building and constructing systems and plants. Our planned \ninvestments in these a reas could result in higher costs, especially in the event of cost overruns, without a \nproportionate increase in revenues. Additionally, some of our competitors may have greater financial, \nresearch and technological resources. They may also be in a better position to identify market trends, adapt \nto changes in industry and offer innovative approaches to these new endeavours.  Accordingly, if we do not \nsuccessfully develop new renewable areas including green hydrogen, green chemicals and energy storage \nsyste ms in a timely, cost -effective manner that is attractive to our customers, our business, financial condition, \ncash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.  \n \n37. The renewable energy market in India is at a relatively early stage of development and trends in the \nrenewable energy industry are based only on limited data and may not be reliable.  \n \nThe renewable energy market is at a relatively early stage of development in India, and trends in the renewable \nenergy industry are based only on limited data and may not be reliable. Installed capacity of renewable energy \nsources have increased from 63 GW  in Fiscal 2012 to 123 GW in Fiscal 2019 to approximately 191 GW \n(including large hydro) in March 2024. (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024).    \n \nMany factors may affect the demand for renewable projects in India, including:  \n \n\u2022 fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non -\nrenewable energy sources;  \n\u2022 the cost and reliability  of renewable  energy compared  to conventional  and other  renewable  energy \nsources;  \n\u2022 the availability  of grid capacity  to dispatch  power  generated  from  renewable  energy  projects;   \n\u2022 public perceptions of the direct and indirect benefits of adopting renewable energy technology; and  \n\u2022 regulations  and policies governing the electric utility industry that may present technical, regulatory \nand economic barriers to the purchase and use of renewable energy.  \n \nIf the renewable energy market fails to develop sufficiently, our business, results of operations and financial \ncondition could be materially and adversely affected.  \n \n38. Our profitability is dependent in part on our ability to manage costs during the terms of our project PPAs \nand operate our solar and wind power projects at optimal levels. If we unable to manage the costs effectively \nor operate our power projects at optima l levels, our business, results of operations, financial condition and \ncash flows may be adversely affected.  \n \nOur Company has been profitable in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, \nFiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.

If we are unable to manage the costs effectively \nor operate our power projects at op timal levels, our business, results of operations, financial condition and \ncash flows may be adversely affected .  \n \n39. Any failure by us to adapt to industry trends and evolving technologies in the renewable energy sector to \nmeet our customers\u2019 demands may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  \n \nChanges in regulatory or industry requirements, or competitive technologies may render certain of our \nrenewable energy obsolete or less attractive. For instance, the demand for renewable energy sources including \ngreen hydrogen is due to the increased demand for cleaner fuels to reduce carbon emissions from conventional \nenergy sources. ( Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024 ). Any studies or market perceptions that suggest \nthat a particular renewable energy source is ineffective or less effective at reducing c arbon emissions could \nadversely affect the demand for that renewable energy source or system. Further, the adoption of new \nenvironmental regulations could adversely impact demand for certain renewable energy sources. In addition, \ntechnological advances may  alter the demand for certain sources of renewable energy as alternative energy \nsources are developed.  For example, according to CRISIL Research, increased adoptions of electric vehicles \nmay reduce hydrogen demand as electric battery life increases and ba tteries are able to cater to the long -haul \ntransport of heavy goods. Technological advances that reduce the demand for a particular renewable energy \nsource could adversely affect our business and prospects.  \n \n40. The reduction, modification or elimination of government and economic incentives may reduce the \neconomic benefits of our existing renewable energy projects and our opportunities to develop or acquire \nnew renewable energy projects.  \n \nThe development and profitability of renewable energy projects in the locations in which we operate are \ndependent on policy and regulatory frameworks that support such developments. Changes in policies could \nlead to a significant reduction in or a disconti nuation of the support for renewable energy projects in such \nlocations. Without such support, renewable energy projects might not be commercially viable in such \nlocations.   \n \nWe have received government grants under viability gap funding ( \u201cVGF \u201d) support received from \nMNRE/Central Government for some of our projects.

If such direct and indirect \ngovernment support for renewable energy (in particular, solar and wind power) is terminated or reduced, it \nwould make producing electricity from solar and wind power projects less competitive and r educe demand \nfor new renewable energy projects.  \n \nIn addition, the projects in which government entities participate may be subject to delays, extensive internal \nprocesses, policy  changes,  changes  due  to  local,  national  and  internal  political  pressures  and  changes  \nin  governmental  or  extern al budgetary allocation and insufficiency of funds. Since government entities are \nthe offtakers for such projects, these projects are directly and significantly dependent on their support. Any \nwithdrawal of support or adverse changes in their policies may lead to the agreements being renegotiated and \ncould also adversely affect the financing, capital expenditure, revenues, development or operations relating \nto the projects.  \n \n41. Changes in technology may render our current technologies obsolete or require us to make substantial  \ncapital investments. Failure to respond to current and future technological changes in an effective and  \ntimely manner may adversely affect our business and results of operations.  \n \nAs part of our business, we leverage technology to improve efficiency, plant availability and output. However, \nthe technology required for renewable energy power projects are subject to continuous change and \ndevelopment. Some of our existing technologies a nd processes in the renewable energy business may become \nobsolete or perform less efficiently compared to newer and better technologies and processes.  For example, \nthe solar photovoltaic  (PV) market is dominated by monocrystalline silicon technology. With in \nmonocrystalline technology, mono PERC is an advanced version that employs dielectric passivation film on \nthe rear surface of the cells which increases the efficiency levels.  These cells are currently leading the market \ndue to higher efficiency, cover less space, higher output in low light conditions and are available at \ncompetitive pricing . (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024).   For further information on new technologies, \nsee \u201c Industry Overview \u2013 Growth Drivers for Solar Sector in India \u2013 Favourable Technology \u201d on page 167. \n \nThe cost of upgrading or implementing new technologies, upgrading our existing equipment or expanding \ncapacity could be significant and may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to pass on \nsuch costs to our customers or recover such c osts from revenue. Failure to respond to current and future \ntechnological changes in an effective and timely manner may adversely affect our business, results of \noperations and financial condition.  \n \n42. Our inability to successfully implement some or all of our business strategies in a timely manner or at all \ncould have an adverse effect on our business. Further, our failure to manage growth effectively may \nadversely impact our business, results of operat ions and financial condition.  \n \nWe have built our business organically and through joint ventures, and we have demonstrated consistent \ngrowth in terms of revenues and profitability.  \n \nAs part of our strategy aimed towards business growth and improvement of market position, we intend to \nimplement several business strategies, which include:  \n \n\u2022 Continue to grow project pipeline through prudent bidding and strategic joint ventures with PSUs and \nprivate companies;  \n \n\u2022 Focus on projects in hydrogen, green chemicals and storage;  \n \n\u2022 Drive efficiency and cost reductions in project execution and operations & maintenance; and  \n \n\u2022 Continue to be at the forefront of India\u2019s sustainability efforts.  \n    \n68 \n The aforesaid strategies are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Our inability to successfully implement \nsome or all our business strategies in a timely manner or at all could have an adverse effect on our business. \nFurther, our failure to manage growth effectively may adversely impact our business, results of operation s \nand financial condition.  \n \nOur strategies may not succeed due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our \ninability to reduce our debt and our operating costs, our failure to develop new renewable energy sources and  \nsystems with sufficient growth potential as per the changing market preferences and trends, our failure to \nexecute agreements with our suppliers and technology and strategic partners, to execute agreements with \nofftakers, our failure to sufficiently upgrade our in frastructure equipment and tec hnology as required to cater \nto the requirement of changing demand and market preferences, our failure to maintain highest quality \nengineering and consistency in our operations or to ensure scaling of our operations to correspond with our \nstrategies and cu stomer demand, changes in laws and regulations in India, our inability to respond to regular \ncompetition, and other operational and management difficulties.  \n \n43. We are dependent upon the experience and skill of our Key Managerial Personnel and Senior \nManagement. Except for our Executive Directors, all Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management \nof our Company are on secondment basis from NTPC Limited. If we are  unable to attract or retain such \nqualified personnel, this could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nWe are dependent on our Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management for setting our strategic business \ndirection and managing our business. Except for our Executive Directors, all Key Managerial Personnel and \nSenior Management of our Company are on secondment basis from NTPC Limited . Our ability to meet \ncontinued success and future business challenges depends on our ability and NTPC Limited\u2019s ability to attract, \nrecruit and retain experienced, talented and skilled professionals. Without enough skilled em ployees, our \nengineering, execution, operations and maintenance quality could suffer.

We have issued Equity Shares during the preceding 12 months from the date of this Prospectus at a price \nwhich may not be indicative of the Issue Price.     \n70 \n Details of the Equity Shares issued in the last 12 months from the date of this Prospectus are set out in the \ntable below.  \nDate of \nallotment of \nEquity \nShares  Name(s) of \nallotee(s)  Number of \nEquity \nShares \nallotted  Face Value \nper Equity \nShare (\u20b9)  Issue Price \nper Equity \nShare (\u20b9)  Nature of \nConsideration  Reason for \nallotment  \nMarch 28, \n2024  NTPC \nLimited  1,000,000,000  10 10 Cash  Rights issue  \nSeptember 7, \n2024  NTPC \nLimited  1,780,388,965  10 10 Cash  Right issue  \n \nThe Issue Price is not indicative of the price at which our Company has issued the Equity Shares in the \npreceding 12 months or that will prevail in the open market following listing of the Equity Shares. For details, \nsee \u201cCapital Structure\u201d on page 113.  \n46. We may not be successful in pursuing joint ventures, strategic partnerships, and future joint ventures and \npartnerships. Any failure in developing the projects through partnerships and JVs could adversely affect \nour business, results of operation and finan cial condition.    \n \nA principal component of our strategy is to expand our operations by growing our project portfolio through \nstrategic partnerships and joint ventures and adopting new technologies for peak power supply, round the \nclock supply and battery storage services. W e are continuing to explore joint venture and partnership \nopportunities with complementary and strategic businesses. For example, we have joint ventures in place \nwith signed joint venture agreements with Indian Oil Corporation Limited and three other PSUs.  For detailed \ninformation on our joint ventures for which we have signed an MOU or joint venture agreements, see \u201c Our \nBusiness \u2013 Our Projects \u2013Pipeline and Joint Ventures \u201d on page 219.  \nWe may not be able to identify suitable strategic investment, joint venture or partnership opportunities at \nacceptable cost and on commercially reasonable terms, obtain the financing necessary to complete and \nsupport such investments or integrate such busi nesses or investments effectively. Any failure to successfully \nintegrate the portfolio of projects of these investments, joint ventures or partnerships may limit our ability to \ngrow our business. Thus, any failure in developing the projects through partner ships and JVs could adversely \naffect our business, results of operation and financial condition.  \nFurther, we have signed MOUs or term sheets with other PSUs/private corporates.  We may not be successful \ninto reaching a joint venture agreement with companies for which we have signed MOUs, which may \nadversely impact our business and prospects.  For exam ple, we were unable to finalize one joint venture \ndespite entering into a MoU.  \n \n47. There are outstanding legal proceedings against our Company, our Corporate Promoter  and our Material \nSubsidiary . Any adverse decision in such proceedings may render us/them liable to liabilities/penalties and \nmay adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nCertain legal proceedings involving our Company, Corporate Promoter, and our Material Subsidiary are \npending at different levels of adjudication before various courts, tribunals and authorities. In the event of \nadverse rulings in these proceedings or consequent levy of penalties, we may need to make payments or make \nprovisions for future payments, and  which may increase expenses and current or contingent liabilities.  \nA summary of outstanding litigation proceedings involving our Company, Promoters, and  Material \nSubsidiary , as disclosed in \u201c Outstanding Litigation and Other Material Developments \u201d on page 521 in terms \nof the SEBI ICDR Regulations as at the date of this Prospectus is provided below.     \n71 \n Name  Criminal \nproceedings  Tax \nproceedings  Statutory \nor \nregulatory \nactions  Disciplinary \nactions by the \nSEBI or Stock \nExchanges \nagainst our \nPromoter  Material \ncivil \nlitigation  Aggregate* amount \ninvolved  \n(\u20b9 in million ) \nCompany  \nBy our Company  NIL NIL 5 NIL NIL 3,903.20  \nAgainst our Company  NIL NIL 3 NIL NIL 480.00  \n \nBy our Directors  NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL \nAgainst our Directors  NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL \nCorporate Promoter  \nBy our Corporate \nPromoter  4 88 1 NIL 1 43,849.36  \nAgainst our Corporate \nPromoter  19 4 NIL NIL 1 56,719.66  \nSubsidiaries  \nBy our Subsidiaries  NIL NIL 6 NIL NIL 790.00  \nAgainst our Subsidiaries  NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL \nGroup Companies  \nOutstanding litigation \nwhich may have a \nmaterial impact on our \nCompany  NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL \n               *Amount to the extent quantifiable  \n        For further information, see \u201c Outstanding Litigation and Other Material Developments \u201d on page 521. \nWe cannot assure you that any of the outstanding litigation matters will be settled in our favour, or that no \n(additional) liability will arise out of these proceedings. We are in the process of litigating these matters. \nFurther, such proceedings could divert management time and attention and consume financial resources in \ntheir defence. In addition to the foregoing, we could also be adversely affected by complaints, claims or legal \nactions brought by persons, before vario us forums such as courts, tribunals, consumer forums or sector -\nspecific or other regulatory authorities in the ordinary course or otherwise, in relation to our products, our \ntechnology, our branding or our policies or any other acts/omissions. Further, we may be subject to legal \naction by our employees and/or ex -employees in relation to alleged grievances such as termination of their \nemployment with us. There can be no assurance that such complaints or claims will not result in \ninvestigations, enquiries or legal actions by any courts, tribunals or regulatory authorities against us.  \n48. Our inability to make timely payment of our statutory dues could result us into paying interest on the delay \nin payment of statutory dues which could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and \nfinancial condition.  \n \nSet out below are details of payment of statutory dues by the Company and its Subsidiaries:  \n \nNature of \nPayment Restated Consolidated Financial  \nInformation (1) \nSix months period ended  \nSeptember 30, 2024  Fiscal 2024  Fiscal 2023  \nNo. of \nemployees  Total \nDues  Paid  Unpaid  No of \nemployees  Total \nDues  Paid  Unpaid  No. of \nemployees  Total \nDues  Paid  Unpaid  \nTax \ndeducted \nat source \non salary  232 65.10  65.10  NIL 206 155.89  155.89  NIL 111 64.30  64.30  NIL \nTotal  232 65.10  65.10  NIL 206 155.89  155.89  NIL 111 64.30  64.30  NIL \n*Based on our restated consolidated financial information for the six months period ended September 30, 2024, Fiscal \n2024 and Fiscal 2023.  In Fiscal 2023, our restated consolidated financial information is from April 7, 2022, our \nCompany\u2019s date of incorporation, and includes only 31 days of operation from  February 28, 2023 , after the renewable \nenergy assets of NTPC Limited and the 100% shareholding in NTPC Renewable Energy Limited were transferred from \nNTPC Limited to our Company.     \n72 \n In the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, there have been no \ndelays in payment or failure to make payments of statutory dues towards regulatory authorities by our \nCompany and our Subsidiaries.  \n \n49. Our Statutory Auditors have included in their examination report emphasis of matters that were included \nin the underlying auditor\u2019s reports on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, \n2024 and our interim consolidated financial statements for the six months period ended  September 30, \n2024  and September 30, 2023 . \n \nOur Statutory Auditors have included in their examination report emphasis of matters that were included in \nthe auditor\u2019s report on the interim consolidated financial statements for the six months period ended \nSeptember 30, 2024  and September 30, 2023  as follows:  \n\u201cWe draw attention to the following matters in the notes to the Restated Consolidated Financial Statements:  \n1. Note No. 32(a) regarding balance confirmations from parties. We note that no balance confirmation \nrequests were sent to customers appearing under trade receivables and to other parties as on 30 September, \n2024 and 30 September, 2023 as the Company has p ractise to issue such letters only once in a year as on \nDecember 31. These balances are subject to confirmation / reconciliation and adjustment, if any and, will be \naccounted for on confirmation / reconciliation of the same.   \n \n2. Note No. 48(c) regarding entering into a lease deed on 19 February 2024 for 1,200 acres of land for a \nperiod of 33 years for development of the Green Hydrogen Hub in the State of Andhra Pradesh. As per the \napproval of the Board of Directors of the holdi ng company (\u201cNTPC Limited\u201d) and of the Company, an \namount of \u20b9 10,034.52 Million (net of refund received) incurred by holding company on this land was \nreimbursed by the Company to the holding company. Entire amount reimbursed is shown under \u201cRight of \nUse a sset\u201d as on 30 September 2024 and 31 March 2024.  Amortization of ROU, kept in Capital Work in \nProgress amounting to \u20b9 202.75 Million as on 30 September 2024 and \u20b9 50.85 Million as on 31 March 2024, \ncommenced w.e.f. 19 February 2024 taking lease term as 33  years as the identification of underlying assets \nto be acquired and their useful life is yet to be ascertained by the management.  \n \n3.

Note No. 32(a) regarding obtaining periodic balance confirmations from parties. We note that no \nbalance confirmation requests were sent to customers appearing under trade receivables and to certain other \nparties as on 31 December 2023. Some of such balances are subject to confirmation / reconciliation and \nadjustment, if any, will be accounted for on confirmation / reconciliation of the same.  \n \n2. Note No. 48(c) regarding entering into a lease deed on 19 February 2024 for 1,200 acres of land for a \nperiod of 33 years with Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited (\u201cAPIIC\u201d) for \ndevelopment of the Green Hydrogen Hub in Andhra Pradesh  whereas this land was earlier on lease with \nNTPC Limited (\u201cUltimate Holding Company \u201c) since year 2014 and APIIC now agreed for transfer of \nallotment in the name of the Holding Company. As per the approval of the Board of Directors of the Ultimate \nholding  Company and of the Holding Company, an amount of \u20b910,034.52 Million (net of reimbursement \nreceived) incurred by holding company till date was reimbursed by the Holding Company to the Ultimate \nHolding Company which includes down payment of lease charges of  \u20b97,284.60 Million and various other \ncharges, including interest on unpaid dues of land, GST on interest paid, restoration charges and various \nother amounts, aggregating to \u20b92,749.92 Million. Entire amount reimbursed is shown under \u201cRight of Use \nasset\u201d as on 31 March 2024.  Amortization of ROU commenced w.e.f. 19 February 2024 taking lease term \nas 33 years as useful life of underlying asset is not ascertainable at this stage.\u201d  \n \nThe Emphasis of matter as highlighted by the Statutory Auditors regarding confirmation of balances and \nPudimadka Lease are informative in nature and the auditors have also expressed in their Audit report that \ntheir opinion is not modified. In respect of la nd pending legal formalities, we are  taking appropriate steps to \ncomplete the pending formalities.  There is no impact on our financial statements.  \nWe cannot assure you that our Statutory Auditors\u2019 reports for any future financial period will not contain \nsimilar matters or other remarks, observations or other matters prescribed under Companies (Auditor\u2019s \nReport) Order 2020, and that such matters will not otherwise affect our results of operations.  \n50. We do not own the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name or logo and there is no formal agreement with NTPC limited \nfor the use of the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark. Further, our  logo and name have not been registered as trademarks. \nAccordingly, our ability to use our name or logo ma y be impaired. We also rely on a combination of trade \nsecret and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. If we are unable to protect our \nintellectual property rights, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be  adversely \naffected. As part of our operations, we might infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and \nany misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position.  \n \nThe \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name and logo do not belong to us, which is registered in the name of our Corporate \nPromoter with the trademark registry. Although we have consent to use their name, we do not have a formal \nagreement with, or pay, our Corporate Promot er for the use of the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name or logo, and \nthere is no assurance that we will continue to be able to use the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name or logo in connection \nwith our business, which in turn may result in us being unable to capitalize on the bra nd recognition associated \nwith the NTPC\u201d trademark.  In addition, we have not registered a trademark for our corporate name or logo.   \nWe cannot assure you that the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name or logo our name or logo will not be adversely \naffected in the future by events such as actions that are beyond our control, including action or inaction of \nentities using the \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name or l ogo, regulatory actions against such companies or adverse    \n74 \n publicity from any other source. For example, adverse publicity associated with the NTPC\u201d trademark, name \nor logo, even if unfounded could in the future have an adverse effect on our financial position and reputation. \nAny damage to this trademark, name or logo, if not immediately and sufficiently remedied, could have an \nadverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  \nFurther, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against third -party infringement and \nunauthorised use of our intellectual property, including by our competitors. Any failure to protect our \nintellectual property rights may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \nThis may in turn affect our brand value, and consequently, our business. Despite our efforts to protect our \nproprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our proprietary pr oducts, technology, systems \nand processes and use information that we consider proprietary. Further, unauthorized parties may also \nattempt, or successfully endeavour, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade \nsecrets through various methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of \nprotecting this data may be inadequate. In addition, our trade secrets may become known or independently \ndeveloped by our competitors, and in such cases, we may no long er enjoy the exclusive use of some of our \nconfidential information relating to our products.  \n \nWhile our agreements with our employees and consultants who develop our intellectual property including \nour proprietary products, technology, systems and processes on our behalf include confidentiality provisions \nand provisions on ownership of intellectual  property developed during employment or specific assignments, \nas applicable, these agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential \ninformation, our intellectual property including our proprietary products, technol ogy, systems and processes \nand may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential \ninformation or infringement of our intellectual property.  \n \nAlthough no such proceedings have been initiated during the six months period ended September 30, 2024, \nor during Fiscal 2024 or Fiscal 2023 , we may need to litigate to protect our intellectual property or to defend \nagainst third party infringement. Any such litigation could be time consuming and costly, and the outcome \ncannot be guaranteed. We may not be able to detect any unauthorised use or  take appropriate and timely steps \nto enforce or protect our intellectual property. Any inability to use or protect our intellectual property could \naffect our relationships with our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our brand, business, \nresults of operations and financial condition.  \n \nIn addition, although we have faced no instances of intellectual property claims during the six months period \nended September 30, 2024 or during Fiscal 2024 or Fiscal 2023 , and while we take care to ensure that we \ncomply with the intellectual property rights of others, we cannot determine with certainty as to whether we \nare infringing on any existing third -party intellectual property rights, which may require us to alter our \ntechnologies, obtain licenses or cease some of our operations. We may also be susce ptible to claims from \nthird parties asserting infringement and other related claims. If such claims are raised, those claims could: (a) \nadversely affect our relationships with current or future customers: (b) result in costly litigation; (c) cause \nsupplier  delays or stoppages; (d) divert management's attention and resources; (e) subject us to significant \nliabilities; (f) require us to enter into potentially expensive royalty or licensing agreements and (g) require us \nto cease certain activities. While durin g the six months period ended September 30, 2024 or during during \nFiscal 2024 or Fiscal 2023 , we have not been involved in litigation or incurred litigation expenses in \nconnection with our intellectual property rights, in the case of an infringement claim made by a third party, \nwe may be required to defend such claims at our own cost and liabilit y and may need to indemnify and hold \nharmless our customers. Furthermore, necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if \nat all. In additio n, we may decide to settle a claim or action against us, which settlement could be costly. We \nmay also be liable for any past infringement that we are not aware of. Any of the foregoing could adversely \naffect our business, results of operations and financi al condition.  \n \n51. Delays in obtaining, or a failure to maintain, governmental approvals and permits required to construct \nand operate our projects may adversely affect such projects and our business.  \n \nThe construction and operation of our solar, wind and other renewable energy projects, require various \ngovernmental approvals and permits, and may be subject to conditions that may be stipulated by relevant \ngovernment authorities which vary from state to s tate and time to time. There is no certainty that all permits \nrequired for a given project will be granted on time. Although th ere have been no instances in the six months \nperiod ended September  30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, if we fail to obtain or \nrenew such licenses, approvals, registrations and permits in a timely manner, we may not be able to commence    \n75 \n or continue operating our projects in accordance with our contracted schedules or at all, which could adversely \naffect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There is also no certainty that \nrelevant government authorities will not take any action in the future which may expose us to penalties or \nhave a material adverse impact on our operations. Failure by us to renew, maintain or obtain the required \npermits or approvals at the requisite time may result in the interruption o f our operations and may have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \nFurthermore, our regulatory permits and approvals are subject to numerous conditions, some of which are \nonerous and require us to make substantial expenditure. Although th ere have been no instances in the six \nmonths period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022,  if  we fail to \ncomply, or a regulator claims we have not complied with these conditions, our business, financial condition \nand results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Further, we cannot assure that the approvals, \nlicenses, registrations and permits issued to us would not be suspended or revoked in the event of non -\ncompliance or alleged non -compliance with any terms or conditions thereof, or pursuant to any regulatory \naction. Any failure to renew the approvals that have expired or apply fo r and obtain the required approvals, \nlicenses, registrations or permits, or any suspension or revocation of any of the approvals, licenses, \nregistrations or permits that have been or may be issued to us, may impede our operations. For details of \npending ap provals relating to our business and operations, see \u201cGovernment and Other Approvals\u201d on page \n536. Such pending material approvals do not have any financial impact, we cannot assure you that we will \nreceive such approvals on time or at all. While there hav e been no such instances of any show -cause notices \nin relation to non -compliance with any licenses and approvals, we cannot assure you that that we will not \nreceive any such notices in future.  \nWe are also exposed to changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate, including \nchanging taxes and tariffs and data privacy and protection laws which could, increase our operating costs, or \nresult in litigation or regulatory action. I f we fail to comply with the applicable regulations or if the regulations \ngoverning our business are amended, or if there is any adverse interpretation of applicable regulations by any \njudicial, regulatory or administrative authority, we may incur increase d costs, be subject to penalties, have \nour approvals and permits revoked or suffer a disruption in our operations, any of which could adversely \naffect our business and results of operations.  \n52. Our operations have inherent safety risks and hazards that require continuous oversight and substantial \ninsurances coverage.  \n \nConstruction and generation of power from renewable power generation facilities and plants involves inherent \nsafety risks and hazards which must be identified and mitigated. Power generation involves hazardous \nactivities, including high voltages in key equ ipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution \nsystems. Natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, \nstructural collapse and machinery failure also are inherent risks in our operat ions. These and other hazards \ncan cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and \ncontamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance \nprotection that we c onsider adequate, but we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance will be sufficient \nor effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. \nFurthermore, our insurance coverage is subject to deductible s, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss \nfor which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition and cash flows. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the in surance \nmarkets, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or \nat rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could materially \nand adversely affect our bu siness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   \n53. Our operations are subject to governmental, health, safety and environmental regulations, and we may \nhave to incur material costs to comply with these regulations.  \n  \nThe power generation business in India is subject to a broad range of environmental, social (including labour), \nhealth, safety and other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain a \nnumber of approvals, licenses, reg istrations and permits for developing and operating power projects. \nFurthermore, our government approvals and licenses are subject to numerous conditions, some of which are \nonerous and require us to make substantial expenditure. We may incur material costs , including clean up or \nremediation costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third -party property damage or personal injury \nclaims, as a result of any violations of or liabilities under environmental or health and safety laws or \nnoncompliance with  permits and approvals, which, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our    \n76 \n reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  \nWe currently fall under an exemption granted to solar photovoltaic projects that exempts us from complying \nwith the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, \n1986. While we are not required to obtain c onsents under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) \nAct, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Hazardous Waste (Management, \nHandling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, E -waste Management Rules 2016, certain proce dural \nrequirements, such as informing the Pollution Control Board, exists. However, there can be no assurance that \nwe will not be subject to any such consent requirements in the future, and that we will be able to obtain and \nmaintain such consents or clear ances in a timely manner, or at all, or that we will not become subject to any \nregulatory action on account of not having obtained or renewed such clearances in any past periods. Non -\ncompliance with such environmental and other similar laws and regulations  will have a material adverse effect \non our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n54. We may not be able to find suitable sites for the development of renewable energy projects. Any failure by \nus to secure suitable sites may materially impact the development of a project and may also result in non -\ncompliance with related conditions under pr oject agreements.  \n  \nOur ability to realize our business and growth plans is dependent on our ability to develop and secure rights \nto sites suitable for the development of projects. Suitable sites are determined on the basis of cost, solar and \nwind resource levels, topography,  grid connection infrastructure and other relevant factors, which may not be \navailable in all areas. Further, solar and wind energy projects must be interconnected to the power grid to \ndeliver electricity, which requires us to find suitable sites with adeq uate evacuation and transmission \ninfrastructure, including right of way. Solar energy and transmission infrastructure projects also require \nsufficient contiguous land for development, which may be difficult to procure on suitable terms. Some \nlocations used  for evacuation and transmission facilities are not owned by us and are located on land owned \nby third parties. Land used for our projects is subject to other third -party rights such as rights of passage and \nrights to place cables and other equipment on th e properties, which may interfere with our right to use the \nland and ultimately impair our operations.  \nAlthough th ere have been no instances in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, \nFiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022,  any failure by us to secure suitable sites may materially impact the development \nof a project and may also result in non -compliance with related conditions under project agreements. If this \noccurs across a number of our projects, our business and prospects cou ld be materially and adversely affected.  \n55. Land title in India can be uncertain, and it may be subject to onerous conditions which may restrict its use.  \n  \nThere is no central title registry for real property in India, and the documentation of land records in India has \nnot been fully computerized. Property records in India are generally maintained at the state and district level \nand in local languages and, while digitization is proceeding in many states, have historically been u pdated \nmanually through physical records. Therefore, property records may not be available online for inspection or \nupdated in a timely manner, may be illegible, untraceable, incomplete or inaccurate in certain respects, or \nmay have been kept in poor condi tion, which may impede title investigations or our ability to rely on such \nproperty records. In addition, there may be a discrepancy between the duration of the principal lease under \ndifferent orders issued by state governments in respect of a particular p arcel of revenue land. Furthermore, \ntitle to land in India is often fragmented, and in many cases, land may have multiple owners. Title may also \nsuffer from irregularities, such as non -execution or non -registration of conveyance deeds and inadequate \nstampi ng, pending or on -going litigation and may be subjected to encumbrances of which we are unaware. In \nsome cases, owners and those traditionally occupying or using land may differ. Any defects in, or \nirregularities of, title may result in a loss of developme nt or operating rights over the land, which may \nprejudice the success of our power projects and require us to write off substantial expenditures in respect of \nour power projects.   \nFurther, some properties used for our solar projects are subject to other third -party rights such as right of \npassage and rights to place cables and other equipment on the properties, which may result in certain \ninterferences with our use of the properties . Our rights to the properties used for our solar projects may be \nchallenged by property owners and other third parties for various other reasons as well. Any such challenge, \nif successful, could impair the development or operations of our solar projects o n such properties.   \nAdditionally, the power projects that we may develop or acquire in the future may be located on land that \nmay be subject to onerous conditions under the lease agreements through which we acquire rights to use such    \n77 \n land and rights of way. Furthermore, the state government may exercise its rights of eminent domain, or \ncompulsory acquisition in respect of land on which our projects are or will be located. Any of this may \nadversely affect our business, results of operat ions, financial condition and cash flows.    \n56. We do not own all the land on which we operate and our leases are subject to conditions and may not be \nrenewed.   \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, we owned approximately 8,900  acres  of freehold land and approximately 45,700  \nacres of leasehold land relating to our projects. Our leasehold land is typically leased for 12 to 40 years. Our \nleasehold land may be subject to conditions under the pertinent lease agreements. Such conditions typically \ninclude restrictions on leasehold interest or rights to use the land, continual operating requirements, and other \nobligations which include obta ining requisite approvals, payment of necess ary statutory charges. Although \nthere have been no instances in the six months period ended September 30, 2024 and in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal \n2023 and Fiscal 2022, we are  exposed to the risk that one or more our  leases will not be extended or will be \nterminated by the relevant lessors. Some of our projects are located, or will be located, on revenue land that \nis owned by the state governments or on land acquired or to be acquired from private parties. The timelin e \nfor transfer of title in the land is dependent on the type of land on which the projects are, or will be, located, \nand the policies of the relevant state government in which such land is located. For revenue land, we obtain a \nlease from the relevant government authority. In certain cases, the land leased for the development of \nrenewable energy projects is obtained on a sub -lease. Such land may be subject to disputes on account of right \nof way, encroachment and other  related issues.  \n \nIn connection with the transfer of RE Assets from NTPC Limited to us, we have not yet received the consent \nof the lessor of the assignment/novation of the transfer of land pertaining to the Rojmal and Jetstar projects.  \nAccordingly, legal formalities for t ransfer of and related to these projects from NTPC Limited to us is under \nprocess. For further information, see  \u201c- The acquisition of the purchased renewable energy assets is subject \nto certain post closing actions, which are currently in the process of be ing fulfilled. Any failure to fulfil the \npost-closing actions may reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or result in a material adverse \neffect on the business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of our Company \u201d on page 41. \n57. One of our borrowing facilities is supported by a guarantee by our Promoter and may need to be refinanced \nif such guarantee was withdrawn for any reason.  \nOur borrowing facility between Japan Bank for International Cooperation and NREL is supported by a guarantee \nby our Corporate Promoter.  This facility had Nil outstanding as at September 30, 2024 .  This facility may need \nto be refinanced if such guarantee was withdrawn for any reason.  \n \n58. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our cost of sales and gross margins \nand could result in exchange losses.  \nAs the functional currency of the Company and our subsidiaries is the Indian rupee, our operating expenses \nare denominated primarily in Indian rupees. However, some of our capital expenditures, and particularly those \nfor equipment imported from international suppliers, such as solar modules and wind turbine generators are \ndenominated in foreign currencies, primarily U.S dollars. We expect our future capi tal expenditures in \nconnection with our proposed expansion plans may include significant expenditures in foreign currencies for \nimported solar panels, components, equipment and machinery.  \n   \nA significant fluctuation in the Indian rupee to U.S. dollar or other foreign currency exchange rates could \nmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The \nexchange rate between the Indian rupee and these currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, has fluctuated in the \npast and any appreciation or depreciation of the Indian rupee against these currencies can impact our \nprofitability and results of operations. Our results of operations have been impact ed by such fluctuations in \nthe past and may be impacted by such fluctuations in the future. For example, the Indian rupee had depreciated \nagainst the U.S. dollar in four of the last five years, which may impact our foreign currency expenditures. We \nhave had gains and losses due to these fluctuations in foreign currency.  \nThe table set forth below provides our foreign currency gain/(loss) for the periods indicated.     \n78 \n Particulars  Restated Consolidated Financial Information (1) Special Purpose Carved -Out \nCombined Financial Statements \n(2) \nSix months \nperiod ended \nSeptember \n30, 2024  Six months \nperiod ended \nSeptember \n30, 2023  Fiscal 2024  Fiscal 2023  Fiscal 2022  \nForeign currency gains \n(losses)  (\u20b9 million)  92.98  - (89.24)  0.00 0.00 \n(1) Based on Restated Consolidated Financial Information for the six months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and for \nFiscal 2024.

Maintenance and expansion of our power generation facilities are provided by third -parties and involve \nsignificant risks that could result in reduced power generation and financial results.  \nOur power generation  facilities require regular maintenance for which we may engage third party operations \nand maintenance contractors. Although we have services contracts with such third parties, we are exposed to \nrisks regarding the quality and timeliness of their services.   Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, \nincluding failure associated with breakdowns, and any decreased operational or management performance, \ncould reduce our facilities\u2019 generating capacity below expected levels and reduce our revenues as a r esult of \ngenerating and selling less power. Degradation of the performance of our projects beyond levels provided for \nin the related PPAs may also reduce our revenues. Our plants may be adversely affected by storms, high \nwinds or flooding, lower solar inso lation resulting in damage and loss of revenue. Unanticipated capital \nexpenditures associated with maintaining, or repairing our facilities may also reduce profitability, especially \nbecause our tariff is fixed in the PPAs, and we may not be able to pass th rough any unexpected costs in \nrelation to the projects to our customers. Furthermore, we are not able to mitigate such project risks through \nappropriate insurance for natural calamities and through performance guarantees by our operations and \nmaintenance c ontractors. Any uncovered risk may result in reduced power generation and will have adverse \nimpact on financial results. This impact we may not be able to recover through insurance. If the situation \nworsens there could be a further adverse impact on our re venues.  \n  \n60. We are dependent on contract labour and any disruption to the supply of such labour for project e xecution \nand Operation & Maintenance or our inability to control the composition and cost of our contract labour \ncould adversely affect our operations.  \n \nOur workforce includes personnel that we engage through independent contractors.  As of September 30, 2024, \nwe had 45 contract labourers. We incur certain contract labour charges for engaging workforce through \nindependent contractors.  \nAlthough we do not engage these labourers directly, we may be held responsible for any wage payments to these \nlabourers in the event of default by our independent contractors. While the amount paid in such an event can be \nrecovered from the independent con tractor, any significant requirement to fund the wage requirements of the \nengaged labourers or delay in recovering such amounts from the contractors may have an adverse effect on our \ncash flows and results of operations.  \nWe are also subject to the laws and regulations in India governing employees, including in relation to \nminimum wage and maximum working hours, overtime, working conditions, hiring and termination of \nemployees, contract labour and work permits. These laws a nd regulations have, however, become \nincreasingly stringent and it is possible that they will become significantly more stringent in the future. For \ninstance, the Government of India (\u201c GoI\u201d) has recently introduced (a) the Code on Wages, 2019; (b) the Code  \non Social Security, 2020; (c) the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020; and (d) \nthe Industrial Relations Code, 2020 which consolidate, subsume and replace numerous existing central labour    \n79 \n legislations. While the rules for implementation under these codes have not been notified, we are yet to \ndetermine the impact of all or some such laws on our business and operations which may restrict our ability \nto grow our business in the future and incr ease our expenses. Furthermore, any upward revision of wages that \nmay be required by the government to be paid to such contract labourers would increase our costs and may \nadversely affect the business and results of our operations. The Central and State Go vernments prescribes \nminimum wages based on consumer price index for different nature of labourers for different categories of \nlocations from time to time. We are bound to pay the contract labour the higher of the minimum wages prescribed \nby the State or C entral Government and any drastic upward revisions could have an adverse impact on our costs \nand profitability in the future.  \nIf we are unable to obtain the services of skilled and unskilled workmen, it may adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations and financial condition.  \n \n61. We may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover our economic losses as well as certain other risks, \nnot covered in our insurance policies, which could adversely affect business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition.  \n \nOur operations are subject to various risks inherent to the renewable energy industry and to the sale of \nelectricity, as well as other risks, such as theft, robbery or acts of terrorism and other force majeure events. \nWe maintain insurance coverage for anticipated risks which are standard for our type of business and \noperations.  We maintain insurance coverage that we consider necessary for our business. We have a standard \nfire and allied perils insurance policy for all ou r operating stations and all risk erection insurance policy \nthrough the contractors for our projects. Insurance against theft, robbery, workmen compensation and general \nliability insurance are being taken by our O&M contractors in the operating stations. W e have not taken \ninsurance to protect against all risk and liabilities. For example, we do not have loss of business income \npolicy.  \nThe table below sets forth particulars of our insurance coverage on a consolidated basis as at the dates \nindicated.  The Company was incorporated on April 7, 2022.  Insurance coverage as at March 31, 2023, and \nMarch 31, 2022 was obtained by our Promoter, N TPC Limited, for its assets.  \nParticulars  As at September 30, \n2024  As at March 31, 2024  \nInsured Assets (\u20b9 million)  1,39,067.50  117,336.50  \nInsured Assets as % of fixed assets (gross block less land cost)  85.16%  79.43%  \nInsured Assets as % of total assets  72.79%  66.68%  \n \nThere are many events that could significantly impact our operations, or expose us to third -party liabilities, \nfor which we may not be adequately insured. There can be no assurance that any claim under the insurance \npolicies maintained by us will be honoured fully,  in part, or on time. To the extent that we suffer any loss or \ndamage that is not covered by insurance or exceeds our insurance coverage, our business, results of operations \nand financial condition could be adversely affected. For further details of insuran ce, see \u201c Our Business -\nInsurance \u201d on page 232.  \nWe have a standard fire and allied perils insurance policy for all our operating stations and all risk erection \ninsurance policy through the contractors for our projects. Insurance against theft, robbery and general liability \ninsurance are being taken by o ur O&M contractors in the operating stations. We have not taken insurance to \nprotect against all risk and liabilities. For example, we do not have loss of business income policy.  \n \nFurther, our insurance coverage expires from time to time. We apply for the renewal of our insurance coverage \nin the normal course of our business. None of our insurance policies are due for renewal as of the date of this \nRHP . \n \n62. The average cost of acquisition of Equity Shares held by our Corporate Promoter NTPC Limited, is \u20b9 10 \nper share, which may be less than the Issue Price.  \n \nThe average cost of acquisition of Equity Shares held by our Corporate Promoter, NTPC Limited, is \u20b910 per \nshare, which may be less than the Issue Price.

It is likely that we will continue to en ter related party \ntransactions in the future. Some of these transactions may require significant capital outlay and there can be \nno assurance that we will be able to make a return on these investments. Although all related -party transactions \nthat we may en ter will be subject to Audit Committee, Board or shareholder approval, as may be required \nunder the Companies Act, 2013 and the SEBI Listing Regulations, we cannot assure you that such \ntransactions, individually or in the aggregate, will perform as expecte d/ result in the benefit envisaged therein.  \n \n64. Certain of our Directors do not have prior experience on the board of directors of publicly listed companies \nwhich may be detrimental to our Board of Directors when making key decisions.  \n \nAs a listed company we will be subjected to the compliance requirements and increased scrutiny of our affairs \nby Shareholders, regulators and the public at large associated with being a  publicly  listed company. As a \npublicly listed company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, corporate governance and other issues \nthat we were not present as an unlisted company. Certain of our Directors do not have prior experience on the \nboard of directors of publicly listed companies  which may be detrimental to ou r Board of Directors when \nmaking key decisions, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial \ncondition.  For further information on our Directors, see \u201c Our Management - Board of Directors\u201d  on page \n252. \n \n65. After the completion of the Issue, our Corporate Promoter will continue to collectively hold substantial \nshareholding in our Company. Further, our Corporate Promoter is controlled by the Government of India \nacting though the Ministry of Power.  \n  \nCurrently, our Corporate Promoter, NTPC Limited, owns an aggregate of 100% of our issued, subscribed and \npaid-up Equity Share capital . Following the completion of the Issue, our Corporate Promoter will continue to \nhold 89.00%  of our post -Issue Equity Share capital . For details of their shareholding pre and post -Issue, see \n\u201cCapital Structure \u201d on page 113. By virtue of their shareholding, our Corporate Promoter will have the ability \nto exercise significant control over the outcome of the matters submitted to  our shareholders for approval, \nincluding the appointment of Directors, the timing and payment of dividends, the adoption of and amendments \nto our Memorandum and Articles of Association, the approval of a merger or sale of substantially all of our \nassets and the approval of mos t other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders. The interests of our \nCorporate Promoter in its capacity as our Shareholder could be different from the interests of our other \nshareholders. Any such conflict may adversely af fect our ability to execute our business strategy or to operate \nour business.  \nFurther, our Corporate Promoter is a public sector company controlled by the President of India, acting \nthrough the Ministry of Power, Government of India. Consequently, the President of India, acting through \nthe Ministry of Power, Government of India, will have indirect control of us and will have the power to el ect \nand remove the Directors and therefore determine the outcome of most proposals for corporate action \nrequiring approval of the Board or the shareholders, including with respect to the payment of  dividends, \npreparation of budgets, capital expenditure, and transactions with other public sector companies.  \n66. Any variation in the utilisation of the Net Proceeds would be subject to certain compliance requirements,    \n82 \n including prior shareholders\u2019 approval.  \n \nOur proposed objects of the Issue are set forth under \u201c Objects of the Issue \u201d on page 124. At this stage, we \ncannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any other expenditure or \nfund any exigencies arising out of competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or \nother factors beyond our control. In accordance with Sections 13(8) and 27 of the Companies Act 2013, we \ncannot undertake any variation in the utilisation of the Net Proceeds without obta ining the shareholders\u2019 \napproval through a special resolution. In the event of any such circumstances that require us to undertake \nvariation in the disclosed utilisation of the Net Proceeds, we may not be able to obtain the shareholders\u2019 \napproval in a time ly manner, or at all. Any delay or inability in obtaining such shareholders\u2019 approval may \nadversely affect our business or operations.  \nFurther, our Promoter would be required to provide an exit opportunity to Shareholders who do not agree \nwith our proposal to change the objects of the Issue or vary the terms of such contracts, at a price and manner \nas prescribed by SEBI. Additionally, the  requirement on Promoter to provide an exit opportunity to such \ndissenting shareholders may deter our Promoter from agreeing to the variation of the proposed utilisation of \nthe Net Proceeds, even if such variation is in the interest of our Company. Further , we cannot assure you that \nthe Corporate Promoter will have adequate resources at their disposal at all times to enable them to provide \nan exit opportunity at the price prescribed by SEBI. In light of these factors, we may not be able to undertake \nvariati on of objects of the Issue to use any unutilized proceeds of the Issue, if any, or vary the terms of any \ncontract referred to in the Red Herring Prospectus, even if such variation is in the interest of our Company. \nThis may restrict our Company\u2019s ability t o respond to any change in our business or financial condition by \nre-deploying the unutilised portion of Net Proceeds, if any, or varying the terms of contract, which may \nadversely affect our business and results of operations.  \n67. Our Subsidiaries and Joint Venture may not pay cash dividends on shares that we hold in them. \nConsequently, our Company may not receive any return on investments in our Subsidiaries and Joint \nVentures.  \n \nOur Subsidiaries and Joint Venture are separate and distinct legal entities, having no obligation to pay \ndividends and may be restricted from doing so by law or contract, including applicable laws, charter \nprovisions and the terms of their financing arrangements. We cannot assure you that our Subsidiaries and \nJoint Ventures will generate sufficient profits and cash flows, or otherwise be able to pay dividends to us in \nthe future.  \n68. Failure or disruption of our IT systems may adversely affect our business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition.  \n \nWe rely on IT systems in connection with financial controls, risk management and transaction processing as \nwell as to manage our power projects. We may be subject to disruptions of our IT systems, arising from events \nthat are wholly or partially beyond our  control (for example, damage or incapacitation by human error, natural \ndisasters, electrical or telecommunication outages, sabotage, computer viruses, or loss of support services \nfrom third parties such as internet backbone providers). Although we have no t experienced material incidents \nin the past, we may in the future experience incidents of system failures, cyber -attacks and frauds, hacking, \nphishing, trojans and theft of data or other types of cyber security attacks or incidents that have a material \nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event we \nexperience systems interruptions, errors, downtime, incidents of hacking, phishing, or breaches of our data \nsecurity systems, this may give rise to det erioration in customer service and loss or liability to us and it may \nmaterially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash \nflows. Such cyber security events could expose us to a risk of loss or misus e of our information, litigation, \nreputational damage, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, fines, penalties or losses that are either \nnot insured against or not fully covered by insurance maintained. We may be required to expend significant \nadditional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.  \n \n69. Failure to maintain confidential information of our customers could adversely affect our results of \noperations or damage our reputation.  \n \nWe enter into confidentiality agreements and non -disclosure agreements with our customers and other third \nparties. Our agreements with our customers also contain confidentiality and non -disclosure clauses. As per \nthese agreements, we are required to keep c onfidential, the know -how and technical specifications, if any,    \n83 \n provided to us by these customers. In the event of any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality \nagreements with our customers, these customers may terminate their engagements with us or initiate litigation \nfor breach of contract. Moreover, most of t hese contracts do not contain provisions limiting our liability with \nrespect to breaches of our obligation to keep the information we receive from them confidential. As a result, \nif our customers\u2019 confidential information is misappropriated by us or our em ployees, our customers may \nconsider us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us, in addition, to seeking termination \nof the contract. Although we have had no incidents during the six months period ended September 30, 2024, \nor during Fiscal 2024 or Fiscal 2023 , assertions in the future of misappropriation of confidential information \nor the intellectual property of our customers against us, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on \nour business, results of operations and fina ncial condition. Even if such assertions against us are unsuccessful, \nthey may cause us to incur reputational harm and substantial cost.  \n \n70. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with \nregulatory standards and requirements.  \n \nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include \nlosses of components, equipment and materials and intentional failures to comply with any regulations \napplicable to us, to provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing \nstandards we have established, or to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized \nactivities to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and deter suc h misconduct, and the \nprecautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or \nunmanaged risk. Although we have had no material incidents of employee misconduct during the six months \nperiod ended September 30, 2024, or during Fiscal 2024 or Fiscal 2023 , if our employees engage in any such \nfuture misconduct, we could face criminal penalties, fines, revocation of regulatory approvals and harm to \nour reputation, any of which could form a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or \nfinancial condition.  \n \n71. If we are unable to establish and maintain an effective internal controls and compliance system, our \nbusiness and reputation could be adversely affected.  \n \nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal measures commensurate with the size \nand complexity of operations. Our internal audit functions make an evaluation of the adequacy and \neffectiveness of internal systems on an ongoing basis so that our operations adhere to our policies, compliance \nrequirements and internal guidelines. We periodica lly test and update our internal processes and systems and \nthere have been no past material instances of failure to maintain effective internal controls and compliance \nsystem. However, we could be exposed to operational risks arising from any potential ina dequacy or failure \nof internal processes or systems, and our actions may not be sufficient to ensure effective internal checks and \nbalances in all circumstances.  \nWe take reasonable steps to maintain appropriate procedures for compliance and disclosure and to maintain \neffective internal controls over our financial reporting so that we produce reliable financial reports and prevent \nfinancial fraud. As risks evolve an d develop, internal controls must be reviewed on an ongoing basis. \nMaintaining such internal controls requires human diligence and compliance and is therefore subject to lapses \nin judgment and failures that result from human error.  \nFurther, our operations are subject to anti -corruption laws and regulations. These laws generally prohibit us \nand our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to \ngovernment officials or other persons to ob tain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We \nparticipate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to \nliability under these laws or other local anti -corruption laws. While our cod e of conduct requires our \nemployees and intermediaries to comply with all applicable laws, and we continue to enhance our policies \nand procedures in an effort to ensure compliance with applicable anti -corruption laws and regulations, these \nmeasures may not  prevent the breach of such anti -corruption laws, as there are risks of such breaches in \nemerging markets, such as India. If we are not in compliance with applicable anti -corruption laws, we may \nbe subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal \nexpenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nLikewise, any investigation of any potential violations of anti -corruption laws by the relevant au thorities \ncould also have an adverse impact on our business and reputation.  \n72. Information relating to the installed capacity, capacity utilisation factor and of our renewable energy \nprojects included in this Prospectus are based on various assumptions and estimates and future generation    \n84 \n and capacity may vary.  \n \nInformation relating to the installed capacity, capacity utilisation factor and electricity kwh generated of our \nrenewable energy projects included in this Prospectus is based on various assumptions and estimates of our \nmanagement and independent certified  engineers, including assumptions relating to capacity calculation \npractice of electricity industry, period during which the project operates in a year due to available sun or wind \nor otherwise, downtime resulting from scheduled maintenance activities, uns cheduled breakdowns, as well \nas expected operational efficiencies. For detailed information on installed capacity, capacity utilisation factor \nand electricity kwh generated of our renewable energy projects , see \u201c Our Business \u2013 Overview \u201d and \u201c Our \nBusiness \u2013 Our Projects \u201d on pages 196 and 213, respectively.  Actual electricity kwh generated and capacity \nutilization rates may differ significantly from historical capacity utilization of our renewable energy projects. \nInvestors should therefore not place undue re liance on our historical installed capacity information included \nin this Prospectus.  \n73. Our Promoters and Directors may have interests in entities, which are in businesses similar to ours and this \nmay result in conflict of interest with us  \n \nCertain of our Promoters and Directors may have interests in entities, which are in businesses similar to ours \nand this may result in conflict of interest with us.  \nWe cannot assure you that our Promoters and Directors will not provide competitive services or otherwise \ncompete in business lines in which we are already present or will enter into in the future. In the event that any \nconflicts of interest arise, our Prom oters and Directors may make decisions regarding our operations, financial \nstructure or commercial transactions that may not be in our shareholders\u2019 best interest. It may also enable a \ncompetitor to take advantage of a corporate opportunity at our expense.  Such decisions could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Should we face any \nsuch conflicts in the future, there is no guarantee that they will be resolved in our favor. Our Promoters ho lding \nEquity Shares may also take or block actions with respect to our business which may conflict with the best \ninterests of our Company or that of minority shareholders.  \n \n74. Certain sections of this Prospectus contain information from the CRISIL Report which we commissioned \nand purchased and any reliance on such information for making an investment decision in the Issue is \nsubject to inherent risks.  \n \nCertain sections of this Prospectus include information based on, or derived from, the CRISIL Report prepared \nby CRISIL Research, which  is not related to our Company, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel, Senior \nManagement or NTPC Limited. We commissioned and paid for this report for the purpose of confirming our \nunderstanding of the industry in connection with the Issue. All such informat ion in this Prospectus indicates \nthe CRISIL Report as its source. Accordingly, any information in this Prospectus derived from, or based on, \nthe CRISIL Report should be read taking into consideration the foregoing.  \nIndustry sources and publications are also prepared based on information as of specific dates and may no \nlonger be current or reflect current trends. Industry sources and publications may also base their information \non estimates, projections, forecasts and  assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. Industry sources do not \nguarantee the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the data. Further, the CRISIL Report is not a \nrecommendation to invest / disinvest in any company covered in the CRISIL Report. Accordi ngly, \nprospective investors should not place undue reliance on or base their investment decision solely on this \ninformation.  \nIn view of the foregoing, you may not be able to seek legal recourse for any losses resulting from undertaking \nany investment in the Issue pursuant to reliance on the information in this Prospectus based on, or derived \nfrom, the CRISIL Report. You should c onsult your own advisors and undertake an independent assessment \nof information in this Prospectus based on, or derived from, the CRISIL Report before making any investment \ndecision regarding the Issue. See \u201c Industry Overview \u201d on page 151. For the disclaim ers associated with the \nCRISIL Report, see \u201c Certain Conventions, Presentation of Financial, Industry and Market Data and \nCurrency of Presentation \u2013 Industry and Market Data \u201d on page 18. \n75. We have in this Prospectus included certain Non -GAAP Measures that may vary from any standard \nmethodology that is applicable across the Indian renewable energy industry and may not be comparable \nwith financial information of similar nomenclature computed a nd presented by other companies.  \n    \n85 \n Certain Non -GAAP Measures relating to our operations have been included in this Prospectus. For more \ninformation on the key performance indicators and non -GAAP financial measures used in this Prospectus, \nsee \u201c Certain Conventions, Use of Financial Information and Market Data and Currency of Presentation \u2014\nNon-GAAP measures \u201d, on page 17. We compute and disclose such Non -GAAP Measures as we consider such \ninformation to be useful measures of our business and financial performance, and because such measures are \nfrequently used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate the operational performance of Indian \nrenewable energy companies, many of which provide such Non -GAAP Measures and other industry related \nstatistical and operational information. Such s upplemental financial and operational information is therefore \nof limited utility as an analytical tool, and investors are cautioned against considering such information either \nin isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our audited and restated fin ancial statements as reported under \napplicable accounting standards disclosed elsewhere in this Prospectus. These Non -GAAP Measures and such \nother industry related statistical and other information relating to our operations and financial performance \nmay n ot be computed on the basis of any standard methodology that is applicable across the industry and are \nnot measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by generally accepted accounting principles, and \ntherefore may not be comparable to financial measures and industry related statistical information of similar \nnomenclature that may be computed and presented by other renewable energy companies.  \n \nExternal Risks  \n \nRisks Relating to India  \n \n76. A slowdown in economic growth in India could cause our business to suffer.  \n \nOur performance and the growth of our business are dependent on the health of the overall Indian economy. \nAny slowdown or perceived slowdown in the Indian economy or future volatility in global commodity prices \ncould adversely affect our business. Addition ally, an increase in trade deficit, or a decline in India\u2019s foreign \nexchange reserves could negatively affect liquidity, which could adversely affect the Indian economy and our \nbusiness. In particular, the COVID -19 pandemic caused an economic downturn in I ndia and globally. Any \ndownturn in the macroeconomic environment in India could also adversely affect our business, results of \noperations and financial condition . \nIndia\u2019s economy could be adversely affected by a general rise in interest rates or inflation, adverse weather \nconditions affecting agriculture, commodity and energy prices as well as various other factors. A slowdown \nin the Indian economy could adversely a ffect the policy of the GoI towards the renewable energy industry, \nwhich may in turn adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to implement our business \nstrategy.  \n77. If inflation were to rise in India, we might not be able to increase the prices of our services at a proportional \nrate thereby reducing our margins.  \n \nInflation rates in India have been volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue in the future. India \nhas experienced high inflation in the recent past. Increased inflation can contribute to an increase in interest \nrates and increased costs to  our business, including increased costs of transportation, wages, raw materials \nand other expenses relevant to our business. High fluctuations in inflation rates may make it more difficult \nfor us to accurately estimate or control our costs. Any increase i n inflation in India can increase our expenses, \nwhich we may not be able to adequately pass on to our customers, whether entirely or in part, and may \nadversely affect our business and financial condition. In particular, we might not be able to reduce our c osts \nor entirely offset any increases in costs with increases in prices for our products. In such case, our business, \nresults of operations and financial condition  may be adversely affected. Further, the Government has \npreviously initiated economic measure s to combat high inflation rates, and it is unclear whether these \nmeasures will remain in effect. There can be no assurance that Indian inflation levels will not worsen in the \nfuture.  \n78. Our business is affected by global economic conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our business, \nresults of operations and financial condition.  \n \nThe Indian economy and its securities markets are influenced by global economic developments and volatility \nin securities markets in other countries. Investors\u2019 reactions to developments in one country may have adverse \neffects on the market price of securi ties of companies located in other countries, including India. Negative \neconomic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficits, or a default on national debt, in other emerging \nmarket countries may also affect investor confidence and cause increase d volatility in Indian securities    \n86 \n markets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. Any worldwide financial instability could also \nhave a negative impact on the Indian economy, including the movement of exchange rates and interest rates \nin India and could then adversely affect o ur business, financial performance and the price of our Equity \nShares.  \n \nChina is one of India\u2019s major trading partners and there are rising concerns of a strained relationship with \nIndia, which could have an adverse impact on the trade relations between the two countries.  \n \nDevelopments  in the ongoing  conflict  between  Russia  and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, Iran and the Houthi \nrebels and certain western countries, have resulted in and may continue to result in a period of sustained \ninstability across global financial markets, induce volatility in commodity  prices,  adversely  impact  availability  \nof natural  gas, increase  in supply  chain,  logistics  times  and costs, increase borrowing costs, cause outflow of \ncapital from emerging markets and may lead to overall slowdown in economic activity in India.  \n \nIf we are unable to successfully anticipate and respond to changing economic and market conditions, our \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition  may be adversely affected.  \n \n79. Changing regulations in India could lead to new compliance requirements that are uncertain.  \n \nThe regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and is subject to change. The GoI or \nState governments in India may implement new laws or other regulations and policies that could affect our \nbusiness in general, which could lead to new compliance requirements, including requiring us to obtain \napprovals and licenses from the GoI, State governments and other regulatory bodies, or impose onerous \nrequirements.  \nUncertainty in the applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change in, \ngoverning law, regulation or policy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including by reason of an \nabsence, or a limited body, of administrative or j udicial precedent may be time consuming as well as costly \nfor us to resolve and may impact the viability of our current business or restrict our ability to grow our business \nin the future. We may incur increased costs and other burdens relating to complian ce with such new \nrequirements, which may also require significant management time and other resources, and any failure to \ncomply may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition .  \n80. Natural calamities, climate change and health epidemics and pandemics in India could adversely affect \nour business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, hostilities, terrorist attacks, civil \nunrest and other acts of violence could ad versely affect our business, results of operations and financial \ncondition.  \n \nIndia has experienced natural calamities, such as earthquakes and floods in recent years. Natural calamities \ncould have an adverse impact on the Indian economy which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, and \nmay damage or destroy our solar, wind a nd other renewable power assets or other assets which are \nconcentrated in one location. Any of these natural calamities could adversely affect our business, results of \noperations and financial condition.  Our operations including our solar, wind and other r enewable power in \nIndia may be damaged or disrupted as a result of natural calamities. Such events also may lead to the \ndisruption of information systems, electrical transmission distribution systems and telecommunication \nservices for sustained periods. Th ey also may make it difficult or impossible for employees to reach our \nbusiness locations. Damage or destruction that interrupts our solar, wind and other renewable power assets \ncould adversely affect our reputation, our relationships with our customers, o ur senior management team\u2019s \nability to administer and supervise our business or it may cause us to incur substantial additional expenditure \nto repair or replace damaged equipment or rebuild parts of our renewable projects. Though some of the losses \nare cov ered under appropriate insurance, the above factors may still adversely affect our business, results of \noperations and financial condition.  \nIndia has from time -to-time experienced instances of social, religious and civil unrest and hostilities between \nneighbouring countries. Military activity or terrorist attacks in the future could influence the Indian economy \nby disrupting communications and making travel more difficult. Such political tensions also could create a \ngreater perception that investments in Indian companies involve higher degrees of risk. Events of this nature \nin the future, as well as socia l and civil unrest within other countries in Asia and Europe, could influence the \nIndian economy and could have a material adverse effect on the market for securities of Indian companies.  \n81. Any downgrading of India\u2019s sovereign debt rating by an international rating agency could have a negative    \n87 \n impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.  \n \nOur borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on the credit ratings of \nIndia. Any adverse revisions to credit ratings for India and other jurisdictions we operate in by international \nrating agencies may adversely impac t our ability to raise additional financing and the interest rates and other \ncommercial terms at which such funding is available. A downgrading of India\u2019s credit ratings may occur, for \nexample, upon a change of government tax or fiscal policy, which is out side our control. This could have an \nadverse effect on our ability to fund our growth on favourable terms and consequently adversely affect our \nbusiness and financial performance and the price of the Equity Shares.  \n \n82. Significant differences exist between Ind -AS and other accounting principles, such as U.S. GAAP and \nIFRS, which may be material to the financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with Ind -\nAS contained in this Prospectus.  \n \nOur Restated Consolidated Financial Information has been compiled from our audited consolidated financial \nstatements prepared and presented in accordance with Ind -AS, and restated in accordance with the SEBI \nICDR Regulations. Ind -AS differs from accounting  principles with which prospective investors may be \nfamiliar in other countries, such as U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Significant differences exist between Ind -AS, U.S. \nGAAP and IFRS, which may be material to the financial statements prepared and presented in accor dance \nwith Ind -AS contained in this Prospectus. Accordingly, the degree to which the financial information included \nin this Prospectus will provide meaningful information is dependent on the prospective investor\u2019s familiarity \nwith Ind -AS and the Companies Act. Any reliance by persons not familiar with Ind -AS on the financial \ndisclosures presented in this Prospectus should accordingly be limited. In addition, some of our competitors \nmay not present their financial statements in accordance with Ind AS and the ir financial statements may not \nbe directly comparable to ours, and therefore reliance should accordingly be limited.  \n \n83. We may be affected by competition law in India and any adverse application or interpretation of the \nCompetition Act may in turn adversely affect our business.  \n \nThe Competition Act, 2002, of India, as amended (\u201c Competition Act \u201d), regulates practices having an \nappreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India (\u201c AAEC \u201d). Under the Competition \nAct, any formal or informal arrangement, understanding, or action in concert, which causes or is likely to \ncause an AAEC, is considered void and may result in the imposition of substantial penalties. Further, any \nagreement among c ompetitors which directly or indirectly involves the determination of purchas e or sale \nprices, limits or controls production, supply, markets, technical development, investment, or the provision of \nservices, or shares the market or source of production or provision of services in any manner, including by \nway of allocation of geogra phical area or number of customers in the relevant market or directly or indirectly \nresults in bid -rigging or collusive bidding is presumed to have an AAEC and is considered void. The \nCompetition Act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by any enter prise.  On April 11, 2023, the \nCompetition (Amendment) Bill 2023 received the assent of the President of India to become the Competition \n(Amendment) Act, 2023 (\u201c Competition Amendment Act \u201d), amending the Competition Act and giving the \nCCI additional powers to prevent practices that harm competition and the interests of consumers. It has been \nenacted to increase the ease of doing business in India and enhance transparency. The Competition \nAmendment Act, inter alia, modifies the scope of certain factors used to  determine AAEC, reduces the overall \ntime limit for the assessment of combinations by the CCI and empowers the CCI to impose penalties based \non the global turnover of entities, for anti -competitive agreements and abuse of dominant position.  The \nCompetition Act aims to, among others, prohibit all agreements and transactions which may have an AAEC \nin India. Consequently, all agreements entered by us could be within the purview of the Competition Act. \nFurther, the CCI has extraterritorial powers  and can invest igate any agreements, abusive conduct, or \ncombination occurring outside India if such agreement, conduct, or combination has an AAEC in India. \nHowever, the impact of the provisions of the Competition Act on the agreements entered by us cannot be \npredicted with certainty at this stage. We may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or \ninterpretation of any provision of the Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the CCI, \nor any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the CCI or if any prohibition \nor substantial penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our business, results \nof operations, cash flows, and prospects.  \n \n84. Investors may not be able to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against us.   \n \nOur Company is a company incorporated under the laws of India. Our Board of Directors comprises members    \n88 \n all of whom are Indian citizens. All of our Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management are residents \nof India and majority of the assets of our Company and such persons are located in India. As a result, it may \nnot be possible for investors outside Ind ia to effect service of process upon our Company or such persons in \nIndia, or to enforce against them judgments obtained in courts outside India.  India has reciprocal recognition \nand enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters with only a limi ted number of jurisdictions, \nwhich includes, among others, the United Kingdom, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. In \norder to be enforceable, a judgment from a jurisdiction with reciprocity must meet certain requirements of \nthe Code of Civil Pr ocedure, 1908. Judgments or decrees from jurisdictions, which do not have reciprocal \nrecognition with India, cannot be executed in India. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money \nrendered by any court in a non -reciprocating territory for civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon \nthe general laws of the non -reciprocating territory, would not be enforceable in India. Even if an investor \nobtained a judgment in such a jurisdiction against us or our officers or directors, it may be requi red to institute \na new proceeding in India and obtain a decree from an Indian court. However, the party in whose favour such \nfinal judgment is rendered may bring a new suit in a competent court in India based on a final judgment that \nhas been obtained in a  non-reciprocating territory within three years of obtaining such final judgment in the \nsame manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in India. If, and to the extent that, an Indian \ncourt were of the opinion that fairness and good faith so required, it would, under current practice, give \nbinding effect to the final judgment that had been rendered in the non -reciprocating territory, unless such a \njudgment contravenes principles of public policy in India. It is unlikely that an Indian court  would award \ndamages on the same basis or to the same extent as was awarded in a final judgment rendered by a court in \nanother jurisdiction if the Indian court believed that the amount of damages awarded was excessive or \ninconsistent with Indian practice. In addition, any person seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India is \nrequired to obtain prior approval of the RBI to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to the execution of \nsuch a judgment.  \nRisks Relating to the Issue and the Equity Shares  \n \n85. The Issue Price, market capitalization to revenue from operations multiple and price to earnings ratio \nbased on the Issue Price of our Company, may not be indicative of the market price of the Company on \nlisting or thereafter.  \n \nSet forth below are details regarding our revenue from operations and restated profit / (loss) after tax for the \nperiods indicated.  \nParticulars   \nSix months period ended \nSeptember 30, 2024  \n Fiscal 2024  \nRevenue  from  operations               \n(\u20b9 million)  10,822.91  \n 19,625.98  \nRestated  profit/(loss)  for the year \n(\u20b9 million)  1,753.00  3,447.21  \n \nOur market capitalization to revenue from operations (Fiscal 2024) multiple is 41.27   times of Issue Price and \nour price to earnings ratio (based on Fiscal 2024 restated profit / (loss) after tax for the year) is 147.95 times  \nat the upper end of the Price Band and 139.73  times  at the lower end of the Price Band. The Issue Price of the \nEquity Shares is proposed to be determined on the basis of assessment of market demand for the Equity Shares \noffered through a book -building process, and certain quantitative  and qualitative factors as set out in \u201c Basis \nfor Issue Price \u201d on page 133, and the Issue Price, multiples and ratios may not be indicative of the market \nprice of the Company on listing or thereafter. Investors are advised to make an informed decision while \ninvesting in our Company taking into consideration the price per share t hat will be published in price \nadvertisement, the revenue generated per share in the past and the market capitalization of our company vis -\n\u00e0-vis the revenue generated per share.  Prior to the Issue, there has been no public market for our Equity \nShares, and an active trading market on the Stock Exchanges may not develop or be sustained after the Issue. \nListing and quotation do not guarantee that a market for the Equity Shares will deve lop, or if developed, the \nliquidity of such market for the Equity Shares.  Accordingly, any valuation exercise undertaken for the \npurposes of the Issue by our Company would not be based on a benchmark with our industry peers. The \nrelevant financial paramete rs based on which the Price Band would be determined, shall be disclosed in the \nadvertisement that would be issued for publication of the Price Band.  The market price of the Equity Shares \nmay be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations in our operating \nresults, market conditions specific to the industry we operate in, developments relating to India,    \n89 \n announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances, our competitors \nlaunching significant new projects, announcements by third parties or governmental entities of significant \nclaims or proceedings against us, volatility  in the securities markets in India and other jurisdictions, variations \nin the growth rate of financial indicators, variations in revenue or earnings estimates by research publications, \nand changes in economic, legal and other regulatory factors.  \n86. The determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions and the Issue Price of \nthe Equity Shares may not be indicative of the market price of the Equity Shares after the Issue. Further, \nthe current market price of some securities li sted pursuant to certain previous issues managed by the Book \nRunning Lead Managers is below their respective issue prices.  \n \nThe determination of the Price Band is based on various factors and assumptions and will be determined by \nour Company in consultation with the Book Running Lead Managers. Furthermore, the Issue Price of the \nEquity Shares will be determined by our Company i n consultation with the Book Running Lead Managers \nthrough the Book Building Process. These will be based on numerous factors, including factors as described \nunder \u201c Basis for Issue Price \u201d on page 133 and may not be indicative of the market price for the Eq uity Shares \nafter the Issue.  Additionally, the current market price of securities listed pursuant to certain previous initial \npublic offerings managed by the Book Running Lead Managers is below their respective issue price. For \nfurther details, see \u201c Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures \u2013 Price information of past issues handled \nby the BRLMs \u201d commencing on page 551. The factors that could affect the market price of the Equity Shares \ninclude, among others, broad market trends, financial performance and results of our Company post -listing, \nand other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that an active market will develop or sustained \ntrading will take place in the Equity Shares or provide any assurance regarding the price at which the Equity \nShares will be traded after listing.  \n87. Subsequent to listing of the Equity Shares, we may be subject to pre -emptive surveillance measures like \nAdditional Surveillance Measures and Graded Surveillance Measures by the Stock Exchanges in order to \nenhance market integrity and safeguard the interest of investors.  \n \nSEBI and the Stock Exchanges, in the past, have introduced various pre -emptive surveillance measures with \nrespect to the shares of listed companies in India (the \u201c Listed Securities \u201d) to enhance market integrity, \nsafeguard the interests of investors and potential market abuses. In addition to various surveillance measures \nalready  implemented,  and to further  safeguard  the interest  of investors,  the SEBI  and the Stock  Exchanges have \nintroduced additional surveillance measures (\u201c ASM \u201d) and graded surveillance measures (\u201c GSM \u201d). ASM is \nconducted by the Stock Exchanges on Listed Securities with surveillance concerns based on certain objective \nparameters such as price -to-earnings ratio, percentage of delivery, client concentration, variation in volume \nof shares and volatility of shares, among other things. GSM is conducted by the Stock Exchanges on Listed  \nSecurities  where  their price  quoted  on the Stock  Exchanges  is not commensurate  with,  among  other  things, the  \nfinancial  performance  and financial  condition  measures  such as earnings,  book  value,  fixed  assets,  net worth, \nother measures such as price -to-earnings multiple and market capitalization.  Upon listing, the trading of our \nEquity Shares would be subject to differing market conditions as well as other factors which may result in \nhigh volatility in price, and low trading volumes as a percentage of combined trading volume of our Equity \nShares. T he occurrence of any of the abovementioned factors or other circumstances may trigger any of the \nparameters prescribed by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges for placing our securities under the GSM and/or \nASM framework or any other surveillance measures, which could result in significant restrictions on trading \nof our Equity Shares being imposed by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges. These restrictions may include \nrequiring higher margin requirements, limiting trading frequency or freezing of price on the upper side of \ntrading, as well as mentioning of our Equity Share s on the surveillance dashboards of the Stock Exchanges. \nThe imposition of these restrictions and curbs on trading may have an adverse effect on the market price, \ntrading and liquidity of our Equity Shares and on the reputation and conditions of our Compan y. Any such \ninstance may result in a loss of our reputation and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and may also \ndecrease the market price of our Equity Shares which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.  \n88. Rights of shareholders of companies under Indian law may be more limited than under the laws of other \njurisdictions.  \n \nOur Articles of Association, composition of our Board, Indian laws governing our corporate affairs, the \nvalidity of corporate procedures, directors\u2019 fiduciary duties, responsibilities and liabilities, and shareholders\u2019 \nrights may differ from those that wou ld apply to a company in another jurisdiction. Shareholders\u2019 rights under \nIndian law may not be as extensive and widespread as shareholders\u2019 rights under the laws of other countries    \n90 \n or jurisdictions. Investors may face challenges in asserting their rights as shareholder in an Indian company \nthan as a shareholder of an entity in another jurisdiction.  \n89. Fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and foreign currencies may have an adverse \neffect on the value of our Equity Shares, independent of our operating results.  \n \nOn listing, our Equity Shares will be quoted in Indian Rupees on the Stock Exchanges. Any dividends in \nrespect of our Equity Shares will also be paid in Indian Rupees and subsequently converted into the relevant \nforeign currency for repatriation, if requir ed. Any adverse movement in currency exchange rates during the \ntime taken for such conversion may reduce the net dividend to foreign investors. In addition, any adverse \nmovement in currency exchange rates during a delay in repatriating the proceeds from a sale of Equity Shares \noutside India, for example, because of a delay in regulatory approvals that may be required for the sale of \nEquity Shares, may reduce the proceeds received by Shareholders. For example, the exchange rate between \nthe Indian Rupee and t he U.S. dollar has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate \nsubstantially in the future, which may have an adverse effect on the returns on our Equity Shares, independent \nof our operating results.  \n90. Our Company\u2019s Equity Shares have never been publicly traded and may experience price and volume \nfluctuations following the completion of the Issue, an active trading market for the Equity Shares may not \ndevelop, the price of our Equity Shares may be volati le and may not be indicative of the market price of \nEquity Shares after the Issue, and you may be unable to resell your Equity Shares at or above the Issue \nPrice or at all.  \n \nPrior to the Issue, there has been no public market for our Equity Shares, and an active trading market for our \nEquity Shares may not develop. Listing and quotation does not guarantee that a market for our Equity Shares \nwill develop, or if developed, the l iquidity of such market for our Equity Shares. Investors might not be able \nto rapidly sell the Equity Shares at the quoted price if there is no active trading in the Equity Shares. The Issue \nPrice of our Equity Shares will be determined through a book -building process and may not be indicative of \nthe market price of our Equity Shares at the time of commencement of trading of our Equity Shares or at any \ntime thereafter.  There has been significant volatility in the Indian stock markets in the recent past, and the \ntrading price of our Equity Shares after this Issue could fluctuate significantly as a result of market volatility \nor due to various internal or external risks, i ncluding but not limited to those described in this Prospectus. \nThese broad market fluctu ations and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Equity \nShares, regardless of our Company\u2019s performance. In addition, following the expiry of the six -month locked -\nin period on certain portions of the pre -Issue Equity Share capital,  NTPC Limited, our majority shareholder, \nmay sell its shareholding in our Company, depending on market conditions and its investment horizon. Any \nperception by investors that such sales might occur could additionally affect the trading price of our Equity \nShares. Consequently, the price of our Equity Shares may be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your \nEquity Shares at or above the Issue Price, or at all. A decrease in the market price of our Equity Shares could \ncause investors to lose some or all of their investment.  \n91. We cannot assure payment of dividends on the Equity Shares in the future.  \n \nAs per Guidelines on Capital Restructuring of Central Public Sector Enterprises, dated May 27, 2016, issued \nby Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, Ministry of Finance, Government of India and \nthe department of Economic Affairs (\u201c CPSE Capital Restructuring Guidelines \u201d), containing the guidelines \nfor payment of dividend, applicable from Financial Year ending on or after March 31, 2016, all central public \nsector enterprise including our Company is required to pay a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after \ntax or 5 % of the net worth, whichever is higher, unless an exemption is provided in accordance with the \nCPSE Capital Restructuring Guidelines. Therefore, subject to the provisions of the CPSE Capital \nRestructuring Guidelines, t he Articles of Association and the Companies Act, the declaration and payment \nof dividend is recommended by the Board and approved by the Shareholders. The dividend distribution policy \nof our Company was approved by our Board in its meeting held on Septemb er 9, 2024.  Further, the dividends, \nif any, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to our results of operations, financial \ncondition, contractual restrictions, and restrictive covenants under the loan or financing arrangements we \nmay enter into. For further details, see \u201c Restated Consolidated Financial Information \u201d and \u201c Financial \nIndebtedness \u201d on pages 282 and 516, respectively. Our Company may also, from time to time, pay interim \ndividends.  \n92. Investors may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of income arising on the sale of and dividend on the    \n91 \n Equity Shares.  \n \nUnder current Indian tax laws, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity \nshares held as investments in an Indian company are generally taxable in India. Securities transaction tax \n(\u201cSTT \u201d) will be levied on and collected by a domestic stock exchange on which the Equity Shares are sold. \nAny capital gain realized on the sale of listed equity shares on a Stock Exchange held for more than 12 months \nimmediately preceding the date of transfer w ill be subject to long term capital gains in India at the specified \nrates depending on certain factors, such as whether the sale is undertaken on or off the Stock Exchanges, STT \npaid, the quantum of gains a nd any available treaty relief. Further, any capital gains realized on the sale of \nlisted equity shares held for a period of 12 months or less immediately preceding the date of transfer will be \nsubject to short term capital gains tax in India. The capital gains tax applicable at the time of sale of equity \nshares, on a stock exchange or off -market sale, is subject to amendments from time to time.  \nFurther, the Finance Act, 2019 has made various amendments in the taxation laws and has also clarified that, \nin the absence of a specific provision under an agreement, the liability to pay stamp duty in case of sale of \nsecurities through stock exchanges wi ll be on the buyer, while in other cases of transfer for consideration \nthrough a depository, the onus will be on the transferor. The stamp duty for transfer of securities other than \ndebentures, on a delivery basis is specified at 0.015% and on a non -delive ry basis is specified at 0.003% of \nthe consideration amount. These amendments have come into effect from July 1, 2020. Capital gains arising \nfrom the sale of the Equity Shares will be exempt from taxation in India in cases where the exemption from \ntaxation  in India is provided under a treaty between India and the country of which the seller is a resident. \nGenerally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India\u2019s ability to impose tax on capital gains. As a result, residents \nof other countries may be liable for ta x in India as well as in their own jurisdiction on a gain upon the sale of \nEquity Shares.  Additionally, the Finance Act, 2020, has, amongst others things, notified changes and provided \na number of amendments to the direct and indirect tax regime, including, without limitation, a simplified \nalternate direct tax regime and that dividend distribut ion tax will not be payable in respect of dividends \ndeclared, distributed or paid by a domestic company after March 31, 2020 and accordingly, such dividends \nwould not  be exempt in the hands of the shareholders, both resident as well as non -resident, and are subject \nto tax deduction at source. We may or may not grant the benefit of a tax treaty (where applicable) to a non -\nresident shareholder for the purposes of deducti ng tax at source from such dividend. Investors should consult \ntheir own tax advisors about the consequences of investing or trading in the Equity Shares.  Further, the \nGovernment of India has recently introduced various amendments to the Income Tax Act, vide  the Finance \nAct, 2024. We have not fully determined the impact of these recent and proposed laws and regulations on our \nbusiness, financial condition, future cash flows and results of operations. Unfavourable changes in or \ninterpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new, laws, rules and regulations including foreign \ninvestment and stamp duty laws governing our business and operations could result in us being deemed to be \nin contravention of such laws and may require us to apply for additional appro vals \n93. QIBs and Non -Institutional Bidders are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity \nof Equity Shares or the Bid Amount) at any stage after submitting a Bid, and Retail Individual Bidders are \nnot permitted to withdraw their Bids after  Bid/Issue Closing Date.  \n \nPursuant to the SEBI ICDR Regulations, QIBs and Non -Institutional Bidders are required to pay the Bid \nAmount on submission of the Bid and are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity \nof Equity Shares or the Bid Amount) at any sta ge after submitting a Bid. Retail Individual Bidders, Eligible \nEmployees bidding in the Employee Reservation Portion and Eligible Shareholders bidding in the \nShareholders\u2019 Reservation Portion can revise their Bids during the Bid/Issue Period and withdraw t heir Bids \nuntil Bid/Issue Closing Date. While our Company is required to complete all necessary formalities for listing \nand commencement of trading of the Equity Shares on all Stock Exchanges where such Equity Shares are \nproposed to be listed including All otment pursuant to the Issue within six Working Days from the Bid/Issue \nClosing Date, or such other time period as required under the applicable laws, events affecting the Bidders\u2019 \ndecision to invest in the Equity Shares, including material adverse changes  in macro -economic conditions, \nour business, results of operation or financial condition may arise between the date of submission of the Bid \nand Allotment. Our Company may complete the Allotment of the Equity Shares even if such events occur, \nand such even ts limit the Bidders\u2019 ability to sell the Equity Shares Allotted or cause the trading price of the \nEquity Shares to decline on listing.  \n94. There is no guarantee that our Equity Shares will be listed on the BSE and NSE in a timely manner or at \nall.  \n    \n92 \n In accordance with Indian law and practice, permission for listing and trading of our Equity Shares will not \nbe granted until after certain actions have been completed in relation to this Issue and until Allotment of \nEquity Shares pursuant to this Issue. I n accordance with current regulations and circulars issued by SEBI, our \nEquity Shares are required to be listed on the BSE and NSE within such time as mandated under UPI \nCirculars, subject to any change in the prescribed timeline in this regard. However, w e cannot assure you that \nthe trading in our Equity Shares will commence in a timely manner or at all. Any failure or delay in obtaining \nfinal listing and trading approvals may restrict your ability to dispose of your Equity Shares.  \n \n95. Holders of Equity Shares could be restricted in their ability to exercise pre -emptive rights under Indian \nlaw and could thereby suffer future dilution of their ownership position.  \n \nUnder the Companies Act, a company having share capital and incorporated in India must offer holders of its \nEquity Shares pre -emptive rights to subscribe and pay for a proportionate number of Equity Shares to maintain \ntheir existing ownership percentages p rior to the issuance of any new equity shares, unless the pre -emptive \nrights have been waived by the adoption of a special resolution by holders of three -fourths of the Equity \nShares who have voted on such resolution. However, if the laws of the jurisdicti on that holders are in does \nnot permit the exercise of such pre -emptive rights without us filing an offering document or registration \nstatement with the applicable authority in such jurisdiction, the holders will be unable to exercise such pre -\nemptive righ ts unless we make such a filing. The Company may elect not to file a registration statement in \nrelation to pre -emptive rights otherwise available by Indian law to the holders. To the extent that the holders \nare unable to exercise pre -emptive rights granted  in respect of the Equity Shares, they may suffer future \ndilution of their ownership position and their proportional interests in our Company would be reduced.  \n96. Any future issuance of Equity Shares or convertible securities or other equity linked securities by our \nCompany may dilute holders\u2019 shareholding and sales of the Equity Shares by our NTPC Limited, our \nmajority shareholder, may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.  \n \nWe may be required to finance our growth through future equity offerings. Any future equity issuances by us \nmay lead to the dilution of investors\u2019 shareholdings in us. Any disposal of Equity Shares by NTPC Limited, \nour majority shareholder, or the perception that such issuance or sales may occur, including to comply with \nthe min imum public shareholding norms applicable to listed companies in India may adversely affect the \ntrading price of the Equity Shares, which may lead to other adverse consequences including difficulty in \nraising capital through offering of the Equity Shares o r incurring additional debt. Additionally, the disposal, \npledge or encumbrance of the Equity Shares by NTPC Limited, our majority shareholder, or the perception \nthat such transactions may occur, may affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. There can be no assurance \nthat we will not issue further Equity Shares or that the shareholders will not dispose of the Equity Shares. \nSuch securities may also be issued at prices below the Issue Price.  \n97. A third party could be prevented from acquiring control of our Company because of anti -takeover \nprovisions under Indian law.  \n \nThere are provisions in Indian law that may delay, deter or prevent a future takeover or change in control of \nour Company, even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your Equity Shares at a premium to \nthe market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you. Although the SEBI Takeover Regulations  have been \nformulated to ensure that interests of investors/shareholders are protected, these provisions may also \ndiscourage a third party from attempting to take control of our Company. Consequently, even if a potential \ntakeover of our Company would result  in the purchase of the Equity Shares at a premium to their market price \nor would otherwise be beneficial to its stakeholders, it  is possible that such a takeover would not be attempted \nor consummated.  \nShareholders\u2019 rights under Indian law and our Articles of Association may not be as extensive and widespread \nas shareholders\u2019 rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions. Investors may face more challenges \nin asserting their rights as a share holder in an Indian company than as a shareholder of an entity in another \njurisdiction.   \n98. Foreign investors are subject to investment restrictions under Indian laws, which limit the ability to attract \nforeign investors, which may adversely impact the market price of Equity Shares.   \nForeign ownership of Indian securities is subject to Government regulation. Under the foreign exchange \nregulations currently in force in India, transfer of shares between non -residents and residents are freely    \n93 \n permitted (subject to compliance with sectoral norms and certain other restrictions) if they comply with the \npricing guidelines and reporting requirements specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which are sought \nto be transferred, is not in compli ance with such pricing guidelines or reporting requirements or does not fall \nunder any of the exceptions specified by the RBI, then prior approval of the RBI will be required. Further, \nunless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the Indian economy up \nto any extent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is required to follow certain prescribed \nprocedures for making such investment. The RBI and the concerned ministries/departments are responsible  \nfor granting approval for foreign investment.  \nAdditionally, shareholders who seek to convert the Indian Rupee proceeds from a sale of shares in India into \nforeign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India require a no objection or a tax clearance \ncertificate from the Indian income tax a uthority. We cannot assure investors that any required approval from \nthe RBI or any other Indian government agency can be obtained on any particular terms, or at all.  \nFurther, pursuant to Press Note No. 3 (2020 Series), dated April 17, 2020 issued by the DPIIT and the Foreign \nExchange Management (Non -debt Instruments) Amendment Rules, 2020 which came into effect from April \n22, 2020, any investment, subscription, purchas e or sale of equity instruments by entities of a country which \nshares a land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a \ncitizen of any such country, can only be made through Government approval route,  as prescribed in the \nConsolidated FDI Policy and the FEMA Rules. These investment restrictions shall also apply to subscribers \nof offshore derivative instruments. The Company cannot assure investors that any required approval from the \nRBI or any other gov ernment agency can be obtained on any particular terms, or at all.

However, these fund \nrequirements and proposed deployment of Net Proceeds have not been appraised by any external/independent \nagency or any bank or financial institution. We may have to revise our funding requirement on account of various \nfactors, such as  financial and market conditions, interest rate fluctuations, access to cap ital, competitive landscape \nand other external factors such as changes in the business environment or regulatory climate, which may not be \nwithin the control of our management.  This may also entail rescheduling of the proposed deployment of the Net \nProceeds at the discretion of our management, subject to compliance with applicable laws.

Further, such factors could also require us to advance the utilisation before the scheduled deployment as \ndisclosed above. For details, see \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 Our funding requirements and the proposed deployme nt of Net \nProceeds have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution or any other independent agency and our \nmanagement will have broad discretion over the use of the Net Proceeds \u201d on page 58.  \n \nSubject to compliance with applicable laws, if the actual utilisation towards the Objects, as set out above, is lower \nthan the proposed deployment, such balance will be used towards general corporate purposes, provided that the \ntotal amount to be utilised towards general corporate purposes will not exceed 25% of the Issue Proceeds, in \naccordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations. In case of a shortfall in raising requisite capital from the Net \nProceeds towards meeting the Objects of the Issue , we may explore a range of options including utilising our \ninternal accruals or undertaking any additional equity and/or debt arrangements. We believe that such alternate \narrangements would be available to fund any such shortfalls.   \n \nSubject to applicable laws, in case of any increase in the actual utilization of funds earmarked for the Objects, \nsuch additional funds for a particular activity will be met by way of means available to our Company, including \nfrom internal accruals and any  additional equity and/or debt arrangements. If the actual utilization towards any of \nthe Objects is lower than the proposed deployment, such balance will be used for future growth opportunities, if \nrequired and general corporate purposes,  will not exceed 25.00% of the Issue  Proceeds, in accordance with the \nSEBI ICDR Regulations.  \n \nDetails of the Objects of the Net Proceeds  \n \n1. Investment in our wholly owned Subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NREL) for repayment/ \nprepayment, in full or in part of certain outstanding borrowings availed by NREL  \n \nWe intend to utilise a portion of our Net Proceeds aggregating to \u20b9 75,000.00 million by way of an investment \nin our wholly owned Subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited, in the form of equity or debt or a \ncombination of both or in any other manner as may be decided  by our Board , in accordance with Applicable \nLaw, after considering certain commercial and financial factors , for full or partial repayment and/ or prepayment, \nin full or part, of certain borrowings availed by NREL from banks and financial institutions. The actual mode of \nsuch deployment will be finalised at the time of investment. We undertake to make the relevant disclosures to \nthe Stock Exchanges  on the finalised the mode of investment into NREL at the appropriate stage,  in accordance \nwith applicable law .  \n  \n126 \n Our wholly owned Subsidiary , NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (N REL ), has entered into various borrowing \narrangements, including borrowings in the form of terms loans and various fund based and non -fund based \nworking capital facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of \u20b9 1,70,574.96 million  on \na consolidated basis. Post repayment/prepayment of the below -mentioned loans, our total borrowings, on a \nconsolidated level, is estimated to reduce to \u20b9 95,574.96  million .  \n \nThe selection of borrowings proposed to be prepaid or repaid amongst the borrowing arrangements availed  are  \nbased on various factors, including (i) cost , expenses and charges relating to the facility , including applicable \ninterest rates; (ii) any onerous terms and conditions attached to the borrowings restricting our ability to prepay/ \nrepay the borrowings and time taken to fulfil  such requirements ,  or obtain waivers/ consents for fulfilment of \nsuch conditions; (iii)  terms and conditions of such consents  and waivers; (iv) provisions of any laws, rules and \nregulations governing such borrowings;  (v) levy of any  prepayment or repayment penalties and the quantum \nthereof ;  and (v) other commercial considerations including, among others, the amount of the loan outstanding \nand the remaining tenor of the loan.  \n \nPursuant to the terms of the borrowing arrangements, prepayment of certain indebtedness may attract \nprepayment charges as prescribed by the respective lender. Such prepayment charges, as applicable, will also be \nfunded out of the Net Proceeds, as per the r equirements of the Company. Given the nature of the borrowings and \nthe terms of repayment/ prepayment, the aggregate outstanding amounts under the borrowings may vary from \ntime to time and NREL  may, in accordance with the relevant repayment schedule, repay  or refinance some of its \nexisting borrowings prior to Allotment. If the Net Proceeds are insufficient for making payments for such pre -\npayment penalties or premiums or interest, such excessive amount shall be met from internal accruals  of our \nCompany and NREL, as required, in compliance with applicable law.     \n \nWe believe that such repayment and/or pre -payment will help reduce  NREL \u2019s outstanding indebtedness on a \nstandalone basis and in turn our indebtedness on a consolidated basis, debt servicing costs, which will improve \nour debt to equity ratio and enable utilisation of our accruals for further investment in our business growth a nd \nexpansion. Additionally, we believe that the leverage capacity of our Company and N REL  will  improve  the  \nability  to  raise  further  resources  in  the  future  to  fund  potentia l  business  development opportunities and \nplans to grow and expand our business.  \n \n \n \n[Remainder of this page has intentionally been left blank ] \n127 \n The following table provides details of the borrowings availed by our Subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited, which are currently proposed  to be fully or partially repaid \nor prepaid (earlier or scheduled) from the Net Proceeds .  \nS.

Developing countries, \nsuch as Brazil and China, have significantly higher per -capita electricity consumption than India. In CY2022, per \ncapita electricity consumption of Brazil (2.5 MWh) was almost double of India\u2019s (1.3 MWh) per capita electricity \nconsumption whereas the annual per capita electricity consumption  of India was around 24% that of China  (5.3 \nMWh) and around 10% of the United Staes (12.7 MWh) .  \n \nBetween fiscals 2023 and 2029, India\u2019s per capita electricity consumption is expected to grow at ~5 -7% CAGR. \nPer capita electricity consumption is expected to gradually improve in the long term as well, as power demand \npicks up on the back of improvement i n access to electricity, in terms of quality and reliability, rising per capita \nincome, increasing EV penetration, railway electrification, on account of intensive rural electrification, resulting \nin realisation of latent demand from the residential segmen t, increased penetration of consumer durables. \nHowever, there are a few factors which could restrict the growth such as improved energy efficiency, focus on \nT&D loss reduction, sustainability targets and increasing share of services in GDP.

The draft agreement called on countries to phase out coal power and inefficient fossil fuel  \nsubsidies to reduce carbon emissions significantly in order to reach a goal of limiting global warming this century \nto 1.5 degree Celsius. The draft recognised that limiting global war ming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require \nrapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including reducing global carbon \ndioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net -zero levels around mid -century.   \n \nCOP26 was a landmark event, as it saw a number of important decisions including  \n\u2022 A commitment to phase down coal power and to accelerate the transition to clean energy.  \n\u2022 A commitment to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030.  \n\u2022 A commitment to provide $100 billion per year in climate finance to developing countries.  \n \nIndia has submitted its updated first NDC working towards climate justice after COP26.

In the last few years, RE has been the focused area for capacity \nadditions which is evident from the fact that RE installations (including large hydroelectric projects), have reached \n~201 GW capacity as of September 2024, compared with 114 GW as of March 2018, constituting about 45% of \ntotal installed generation capacity. This growth has been led by solar  power, which rapidly rose to ~91 GW from \n22 GW over the same period.  \n \nBreakup of installed capacity as of September 2024 (GW, % share)  \n \n \nSource: CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nHistorical trend in power demand and energy requirement  \n \nIndia's electricity requirement has risen at a CAGR of ~8.4% between fiscals 2021 and 2024, while power \navailability rose at ~8.5% CAGR due to strong capacity additions, both in the generation and transmission \nsegments. As a result, the energy deficit declined to 0.5% in fiscal 2023 and further reduced to 0.3% in fiscal 2024 \nfrom 0.7% i n fiscal 2018. Also, strengthening of inter -regional power transmission capacity over the past five \nyears has further supported the fall in deficit levels as it reduced supply constraints due to congestion and lower \ntransmission corridor availability.

In fiscal 2025 (as of September 2024) the peak demand further \nincreased to 250 GW during the month  of May 2024. Prior to the pandemic, electricity demand in India usually \npeaked in August -September, mostly covering the monsoon season. This spike in peak demand was primarily due \nto an increase in domestic and commercial load, mainly space cooling load d ue to high humidity conditions. \nHowever, during post pandemic years, annual peak demand occurred in the summer season (April -July), due to \nextreme heatwave conditions.  \n \nPeak power demand and supply position  \n \n*FY25 as of September 2024; Source: CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nAssessment of power deficit/surplus condition  \n \nOn the back of strong growth in installed capacity, growth in energy availability outpaced demand growth. As a \nresult, the gap between demand and supply narrowed, both in terms of energy as well as peak demand in the \ncountry. Peak demand shortage fell shar ply to 1.4% in fiscal 2024, from 4.7% in fiscal 2015, whereas the energy \nshortage fell to 0.3% from 3.6% during the same period.  \n \nIt is expected that the base deficit to persist, though remaining negligible at 0.3 -0.5% over the medium -term, as \ndeficit is expected in under -penetrated areas due to weak distribution infrastructure, with underserved populations \nexpected to gradually come  onto the grid in the long term.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1069\n1,114 \n1,143 \n1,213 \n1,275 \n1,291 \n1,276 \n1,380 \n1,512 \n1,627 \n888 1031\n1091\n1135\n1,205 \n1,268 \n1,284 \n1,271 \n1,374 \n1,504 \n1,623 \n886\n-3.7%-2.1%-0.7% -0.7% -0.6% -0.5% -0.4% -0.4% -0.5% -0.3%-0.1%\n-10.0%-8.0%-6.0%-4.0%-2.0%0.0%2.0%4.0%6.0%\n20040060080010001200140016001800\nFY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25*(BU)\nEnergy requirement Energy availability Deficit\n164177184 190203216243 250 \n161175183 189201207240 250 \nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25*\nPeak demand Peak supplyGW \n158 \n Energy and peak demand shortage trend during the past 10 years  \n \n*FY25 as of September 2024; Source: CEA; CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nPower demand supply outlook  \n \nLong term Demand drivers and constraints  \n \nPower demand is closely associated with a country\u2019s GDP. Healthy economic growth leads to growth in power \ndemand. India is already the fastest -growing economy in the world, with an average GDP growth of 5.8% over \nthe past decade. The trickle -down effect of government spending on infrastructure through the Nation al \nInfrastructure Pipeline, expansion of the services industry, rapid urbanisation, and increased farm income from \nagriculture -related reforms are key macroeconomic factors that are expected to foster power demand. Significant \npolicy initiatives such as 24 x7 power for all, Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA) scheme to provide \nelectricity connections to all households, green energy corridor to facilitate evacuation of RE power, green city \nscheme to promote the development of sustainable and eco -friendly cities, PLI scheme and low corporate tax rates \namong others are expected to further support power demand in the country.  \n \nApart from macroeconomic factors, power demand would be further fueled by railway electrification, upcoming \nmetro rail projects, growing demand for charging infrastructure due to increased adoption of electric vehicles, and \nhigher demand from key infrastru cture and manufacturing sectors. However, increasing energy efficiency, a \nreduction in technical losses over the longer term, and captive as well as off -grid generation from renewables \nwould restrict growth in power demand.  \n \nRailway electrification and metro rail projects to drive a majority of incremental power demand  \n \nIndian Railways has planned to become a net zero carbon emitter by 2030. Therefore, the Government aimed to \nachieve 100% electrification by fiscal 2025. This leads to incremental power demand of around 23 BUs on average \nevery year between fiscal 2025 to 20 29. The power sector is poised to witness most of the incremental demand \nfrom railway electrification; however, lower energy consumption for electrification per kilometer due to energy \nefficiency improvements will partially offset the demand.  \n \nMetro rail has seen substantial growth in India in recent years, and the rate of growth is set to double or triple in \nthe coming years with multiple cities seeking metro rail services to meet daily mobility requirements. As of May \n31, 2024, around 712 km o f metro rail is under construction and 1,878 km is proposed to be added. These \ndevelopments are expected to add incremental power demand of 5 -6 BUs every year on average between fiscal \n2025 to 2029. Currently, metro rail projects constitute a marginal shar e of total incremental demand, but the share \nis expected to increase due to a large quantum of upcoming metro projects.  \nFurther, EV charging requirements are likely to boost power demand over the medium term, with a gradual \nincrease in the share of EVs in the vehicle population. CRISIL MI&A -Consulting projects that the adoption of \nEVs will boost power demand by 12 -13 BUs an nually on average over fiscals 2025 to 2029.  \n \nDeclining T&D losses, an increase in off -grid/rooftop projects and open access transactions to drive power \ndemand downward  \n \nT&D losses have been declining, and the reduction in losses is expected to continue  further aided by a slew of 4.7%\n3.2%\n1.6%2.1%\n0.9%0.7%\n0.4%1.2%4.0%\n1.4%\n0%3.6%\n2.1%\n0.7% 0.7%0.6% 0.5%0.4% 0.5% 0.5%0.3%0.1%\nFY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25*Peak deficit Energy deficit \n159 \n government measures, primarily the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS). RDSS is a reform -based and \nresult -linked scheme for improving the quality and reliability of power supply to consumers through a financially \nsustainable and operationally effici ent distribution sector. Power demand is expected to be reduced by 20 -25 BUs \non average every year between fiscal 2025 to 2029 owing to lower T&D losses.  \n \nFurther, with a boost to rooftop solar and the declining cost of renewable energy generation, decentralized \ndistributed generation is expected to increase, reducing power demand from the grid. By fiscal 2029, 32 -33 GW \nof rooftop capacities are expected to come onstream, resulting in a reduction of 2 -3% in base demand.  \n \nCaptive consumption has been on a rising trajectory since fiscal 2013. The top four industries, namely iron and \nsteel, sugar, aluminium, and steel account for 65% of the total captive consumption. Captive consumption is \nexpected to maintain its growing tra jectory going forward driven by increasing production in the mentioned \nindustries. These industries are expected to add ~3 -4 GW of captive capacity over the next five years, adding on \naverage 290 -300 BUs of demand over the period which may lead to a reduct ion in demand from the grid.  \n \nWith higher tariffs and increasing operating expenses, commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers are opting for \nrenewable energy through rooftops or open access to optimize the production costs. Thus, this segment opens up \nan avenue for more and more RE in stallations and provides an opportunity for RE players to expand their market.  \n \nOutlook on energy requirement and availability  \n \nDespite the high base of preceding three years, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting expects power demand to grow by 5.5 -\n6.0% in the next five years which will be supported by infrastructure -linked capex, strong economic fundamentals \nalong with expansion of the power fo otprint via strengthening of T&D infrastructure, coupled with major reforms \ninitiated by the GoI for improving the overall health of the power sector, particularly that of state distribution \nutilities, are expected to improve the quality of power supply, t hereby propelling power demand.  \n \nEnergy demand outlook (fiscals 2025 -29) \n  \nP: Projected, Source: CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nPeak demand is expected to grow at annual average 5 -6% over fiscal 2024 -29 to reach nearly 318 GW by fiscal \n2029 with an expected persistent high temperatures, rising urbanization, economic growth and infrastructure push \nleading to higher power consumption.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1,627 1,720 1,815 1,914 2,029 2,170 \n1,623 1,717 1,820 1,915 2,032 2,175 \nFY24 FY25P FY26P FY27P FY28P FY29P(BU)\nEnergy Requirement Energy availability \n160 \n Peak demand to increase by 75 GW between fiscals 2025 and 2029 to cross 300 GW  \n \nP: Projected, Source: CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nCapacity addition outlook  \n \nCapacity additions in the conventional power generation segment are projected to be around 32 -35 GW from \nfiscals 2025 to 2029, driven by higher than decadal average power demand.  \n \nNuclear power capacity additions of 5 -6 GW are expected during the period as ongoing projects at Kakrapara, \nKalpakkam, and Rajasthan are nearing completion.  \n \nCRISIL MI&A -Consulting expects 15 -16 GW of hydro power installations including 7 -8 GW pumped hydro \nstorage projects (PSP) capacity additions over fiscals 2025 -2029.  \nRE capacity addition of over 180 -190 GW is expected to be installed between fiscal 2025 -29 driven by various \ngovernment initiatives, favourable policies, competitive tariffs, innovative tenders, development of solar parks \nand green energy corridors, etc. R E capacity is estimated to account for about 50% of the installed capacity of \n660-670 GW by fiscal 2029.  \n \nBESS capacity additions, aimed at storing renewable energy during off -peak hours of power demand to support \npeak supply, are expected to be commissioned starting fiscal 2025, with 23 -24 GW of BESS capacity likely to be \nadded through fiscal 2029.  \n \nAll India installed estimated capacity addition by fiscal 2029 (in GW)  \n \n \nRE includes solar, wind, small hydro, and other renewable sources  \nSource: CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nOverview of Renewable Energy sector in India  \n \nRenewable sources are a clean source of energy as they do not burn like fossil fuels, preventing the release of \npollutants into the air.

Some of these steps taken are as follows:  \n \nFunding from lending institutions such as PFC, IREDA, REC and PFS: Government financial institutions \nsuch as Power Finance Corporation (PFC), PTC India Financial Services Limited (PFS), Rural Electrification \nCorporation (REC) and IREDA are financing many solar projects. As of March 2024, for PFC, the renewable \nenergy port folio crossed Rs. 600 billion (25% increase Rs. 602.08 billion as on 31.03.2024 vs Rs. 481.98 \nbillion as on 31.03.2023). For the Quarter ended 30th June 2024, the PFC has sanctioned Rs. 598 .44 billion \nloans to RE incl. large hydro against Rs. 497.07 billion on Quarter ended 30th June 2023. As of March 2024, \nfor fiscal 2024, REC has sanctioned Rs. 1365.16 billion loans to RE incl. large hydro. For the half year ended \n30th September 2024, the REC has sanctioned Rs. 603.91 billion loans to RE incl. large hydro against Rs. \n499.29 billion on half year ended 30th September 2023. Further, IREDA sanctioned loans amounting to Rs. \n373.54 billion and disbursed loans worth Rs. 250.89 billion during the f iscal 2024. This has led to a significant \ngrowth of 26.71% in the loan book, which stood at Rs. 596.50 billion. For the H1 of fiscal 2025, the IREDA \nsanctioned Rs. 178.60 billion and disbursed Rs. 97.87 billion.  \n \nGreen bond / masala bonds market:  A green bond is like any other bond; however, it invests the proceeds to \nsupport green investments including renewable energy projects. The tenure of the bonds typically ranges from \n18 months to 30 months. India is the second country after China to have na tional -level guidelines for green \nbonds; in India\u2019s case, they were published by SEBI. The green bonds may be issued by the national \ngovernment; multilateral organisations such as Asian Development Bank, the World Bank or the Export -\nimport (EXIM) bank of the country; financial institutions; and corporations.  \n \nPension funds / endowment funds : Pension / endowment funds are expected to play a key role in financing \nsolar projects. Long -term 25 -year PPAs with limited operational risk are very suitable to this investor \ncategory.  \n \nFunding from multilateral banks and International Solar Alliance (ISA):  The Central government channelises \nthe funds available from multilateral banks and financing institutes such as World Bank and KfW. The Central \ngovernment or its representative gets the funds, and it further gets allocated/allocated to various States/Stat e \ngovernment schemes. Funds are also provided to various CPSUs/ Central non -banking financial companies \n(NBFCs) with Indian government backing under the Climate Investment Fund of the W orld Bank. For \ninstance, State Bank of India (SBI) has also received ~US$625 million of soft loans with a long tenure of 20 \nyears from the World Bank at a concessional rate to support viable grid -connected rooftop solar PV projects. \nOn the same lines, KfW Germany provided a 1 -billion -euro loan through IREDA for funding solar projects. \nFurther, European Investment Bank has signed a long -term loan of 150 million euros with IREDA to finance \nclean energy projects in India.  \n \nThe ISA, an association of solar -resource -rich countries, launched by the governments of India and France, aims \nat mobilising $1,000 billion in funds by 2030.  \n \nOverview of solar sector in India   \n165 \n  \nIn the renewable energy basket (including large hydro) as of September 2024, solar energy accounted for a share \nof 45%. Growth in the solar power sector over the last five years has been robust. As much as ~69 GW capacity \nwas added in the segment over fisc als 2018 -25 (as of September 2024), registering a CAGR of ~24.7%, although \non a low base.  \n \nTrend in cumulative solar capacity installation in India  \n \n*FY25 as of September 2024, Source: MNRE, CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nThe GoI imposing solar RPOs across Indian states in 2011, coupled with the sharp drop in capital costs, led to \nmost states releasing solar polices. This resulted in a spur in solar sector investments. Till fiscal 2012, only Gujarat \nand Rajasthan had state solar policies. After the success of Gujarat\u2019s solar policy, other states such as Andhra \nPradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana introduced their respective solar polices.  \n \nThe National Institute of Solar Energy estimated the country\u2019s solar potential at 748 GW, assuming solar PV \nmodules cover 3% of the geographical surface. India is a perfect location for solar energy because of its location. \nIt has 300 days of sunshine each  year, with daily peak electricity use being in the evenings and a seasonal peak in \nthe summer.  \n \nThe daily average Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) in India is around 5 kWh/m2 in north -eastern and hilly areas \nto about 7 kWh/m2 in western region and cold desert areas. The annual GHI varies from 1600 \u2013 2200 kWh/m2. \nStates like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu offers more solar \nirradiance as compared to other parts of India which makes them desirable for installing solar projects.  \n \nGrowth drivers for Solar sector in India  \n \nDeclining module prices and tariffs  \n \nThe global average solar module price, which constitutes 55 -60% of the total system cost, crashed 73% to $0.47 \nper watt -peak in 2016 (average for January -December) from $1.78 per watt -peak in 2010. In fact, prices continued \nto decline to $0.22 per watt -peak by end -August 2019, owing to technology improvement, scale benefits and a \ndemand -supply gap in the global solar module manufacturing industry.  \n \nCRISIL MI&A Consulting expects that post the reapplication of ALMM; the domestic module prices are expected \nto inch up on a quarterly basis as demand for domestic module grows. However, the fall in cell prices will mean \nthat the domestic prices will still be 10 -15% down on year in fiscal 2025 to Rs 0.21 -0.23/wp. On the other hand, \nthe international module prices are expected to register a higher fall of 20 -25% owing to oversupply.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nModule prices declined over 85%% from fiscal 2015 to 2024 (USD/Wp)  22 28 35 40 54 67 82 91\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25*(GW) \n166 \n  \nSource: Industry, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nFiscal and regulatory incentives  \n \nThe Indian government has been offering a variety of incentives to encourage the development of solar power \nplants.  \n \nPM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojna : For further sustainable development and people\u2019s well -being, the Central \nGovernment in February 2024 launched the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojna . This scheme has a proposed outlay \nof Rs. 750 billion and aims to light up 10 million households by providing up to 300 units of free electricity every \nmonth.  \n \nCPSU Scheme : The Central government introduced the CPSU scheme Phase I in 2015 to promote the set -up of \n1,000 MW grid -connected solar PV power projects by CPSUs and government organisations with Viability Gap \nFunding (VGF). Further, the Central Government in March 201 9, approved implementation of CPSU Scheme \nPhase -II for setting up grid -connected Solar PV Power Projects by Central and State PSUs, Government \nOrganisations, with VGF support of Rs 85.8 billion, for self -use or use by Government/ Government ent ities, \neither directly or through Discoms. The maximum permissible VGF was initially two tranches and was kept at Rs \n7 Mn/MW which was subsequently reduced to Rs 5.5 Mn/MW for third tranche. Under this Scheme, the \nGovernment has so far sanctioned about 8.2  GW capacity of solar PV power plants to various entities. Ability of \nCPSUs to execute the scheme at ground level and consumer awareness will play key roles in success of the \nScheme.  \n \nAnnual Bidding Trajectory: MNRE has prescribed an annual bidding trajectory for RE power bids to be issued \nby Renewable Energy Implementation Agencies (REIAs). Bids for 50 GW per annum RE capacity, with at least \n10 GW per annum Wind power capacity, are to be issued each year from 20 23-24 to 2027 -28. This is expected to \nhelp in achieving the targets specified for 2030. Bids of 35.51 GW have been issued by four REIAs (SECI, NTPC, \nNHPC & SJVN) in fiscal 2024 till December 2023.  \n \nNational Solar Mission: Central -level allocations under NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVN) Batch II, \nJawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) Phase II Batch III and IV have been almost entirely \ncommissioned.  \nOperational support to execute solar projects  \n \nApart from providing incentives, the government has lent significant support to the solar power sector for \nexecution of projects.  \n \nSolar parks and ultra mega solar power projects : One of the most important initiatives by the GoI has been setting \nup of solar parks in the country. To overcome the land and transmission related challenges, the scheme for \n\u201cDevelopment of Solar Parks and Ultra -Mega Solar Power Projects\u201d was rolled out i n December 2014 with an \nobjective to facilitate the solar project developers to set up projects expeditiously.   - 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80\nMar-15\nJun-15\nSep-15\nDec-15\nMar-16\nJun-16\nSep-16\nDec-16\nMar-17\nJun-17\nSep-17\nDec-17\nMar-18\nJun-18\nSep-18\nDec-18\nMar-19\nJun-19\nSep-19\nDec-19\nMar-20\nJun-20\nSep-20\nDec-20\nMar-21\nJun-21\nSep-21\nDec-21\nMar-22\nJun-22\nSep-22\nDec-22\nMar-23\nJun-23\nSep-23\nDec-23\nMar-24\nJun-24Module\nprocurement \npossible without \nSRDSGD implementation\nimpacts per unit cost \nby up to 10%\nAvg. -USD 0.69 / \nwpAvg. -USD 0.43 / \nwpAvg. -USD \n0.21/wpAvg. -USD \n0.25/wp \n167 \n  \nAs per the available information, Solar Parks / UMREPPs of aggregate capacity of 39284 MW have been \nenvisaged for development in the country as on 30th September, 2024. Of these, the capacity of 10931 MW has \nalready been commissioned while 8983 MW capacity  is under construction and 19370 MW is under \naward/tendering process.  \n \nFavourable technology  \n \nSolar power is becoming increasingly attractive due to falling module prices and improving efficiency resulting \nfrom excess manufacturing capacity in China and technology advancements, respectively.  \n \nOn the project development front, developers are exhibiting heightened preference for bifacial modules that \ntypically have higher efficiency relative to mono -facial modules and are compatible with tracker technology. In \n2023, the share of bifacial variant in module imports increased from 8% in Q1 2022 to 37% in Q4 2023. On the \nother hand, multi -crystalline modules are being phased out due to lower efficiency and higher degradation rate \u2013 \nshare of import volume was negligible in 2023.  \nCurrently, the solar PV market is dominated by monocrystalline silicon technology. Within monocrystalline \ntechnology, Mono PERC is an advanced version that employs dielectric passivation film on the rear surface of \nthe cells which increases the efficiency levels. These cells are currently leading the market due to higher \nefficiency, cover less space, higher output in low light conditions and are available at competitive pricing.  \n \nIn addition to process improvements, the development of new solar cell designs is essential for achieving further \nefficiency gains while simultaneously reducing material intensity and manufacturing costs. The p -type to n -type \nmigration is currently underwa y and paving the way for new technologies \u2013 by end of 2023, n -type technologies \nincluding TOPCon, heterojunction (HJT) and back contact represented 42% of China\u2019s total module \nmanufacturing capacity (7% in 2022).  \n \nIn addition, there are ongoing considerations for mass manufacturing of multilayer and tandem silicon -perovskite \nor silicon -CdTe hybrid solar panels. These innovative solutions have the potential to significantly increase cell \nefficiency, surpassing the 30% mark, while maintaining competitive production costs and promise to make solar \npower an even  more compelling and sustainable energy solution in the years to come.  \n \nGreen Hydrogen and green ammonia push  \n \nIndia has announced a target of energy independence by 2047 and a net -zero by 2070. Green Hydrogen is expected \nto play a substantial role in achieving these goals. The production of Green Hydrogen using renewable energy \nsources like solar, wind, and hydropower can provide energy security, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and \nensuring a stable and reliable source of energy. Hence, India has l aunched the National Green Hydrogen Mission \nwith an outlay of Rs. 197.44 billion with a target of 5MMT production capacity of Green Hydrogen per annum. \nGreen hydrogen push from the government will likely push for the installation of solar energy for consum ption.  \n \nIn July 2023, SECI has issued a tender for selection of green hydrogen producers for setting up 450,000 TPA \nproduction facilities for green hydrogen in India under the SIGHT Scheme (Mode -1-Tranche -I). Moreover, in \nJuly 2024, MNRE notified guidelines under SIGHT Scheme (Mode -1-Tranche -II) with a capacity of 450,000 \nTPA. SECI has already issued a tender for Tranche -II which is expected to be concluded soon. The Government \nof India has already initiated pilot scheme for use of hydrogen in shipping, steel and t ransport sector.  \n \nThe Green Hydrogen Mission will have wide ranging benefits - creation of export opportunities for Green \nHydrogen and its derivatives; Decarbonisation of industrial, mobility and energy sectors; reduction in dependence \non imported fossil fuels and feedstock;  development of indigenous manufacturing capabilities; creation of \nemployment opportunities; and development of cutting -edge technologies.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOutlook on Solar capacity additions in India   \n168 \n  \nSolar sector growth in India primarily spurred by robust government backing, demonstrated through an aggressive \ntendering strategy. Some of the key catalysts include technological advancements, affordable financing, \nsupportive policies, thrust on go -green initiatives/sustainability targets, cost optimisation due to increased grid \nelectricity tariffs, subsidy initiative (specially in rooftop solar) and various incentives such as ISTS charge waiver.  \nCRISIL MI&A -Consulting expects 137 -142 GW of solar capacity additions over fiscal 2025 -2029. This will be \ndriven by additions under:  \n \n\u2022 NSM : The entire NSM Phase II Batch II Tranche I of 3,000 MW has been commissioned. Under NSM Phase \nII, Batch III, and Batch IV, SECI through its state specific VGF has tendered out ~7 GW of capacities, most \nof which has been completed.  \n \n\u2022 Other central schemes : SECI has also started tendering projects outside the JNNSM Batch programme. It has \ninitiated the ISTS scheme, wherein projects are planned for connection with the ISTS grid directly. Under \nthis, SECI has already tendered and allocated ~35 GW (including h ybrid).   \n \n\u2022 State solar policies : ~24 GW of projects are under construction and are expected to be commissioned over \nthe fiscal 2025 -2029. Based on tendered capacities by states at the end of June 2024, a further ~24 GW \ncapacity of solar projects is expected to be up for bidding over the  same duration.   \n \n\u2022 PSUs : The CPSU programme under JNNSM has been extended to 12 GW in February 2019. The government \nis also encouraging cash -rich PSUs to set up renewable energy projects. Group NTPC (NTPC Limited) has \ncommissioned 4,013 MW as on 30.09.2024 . It has a target of i nstalling ~60 GW of renewable energy \ncapacities by fiscal 2032. Similarly, NHPC Limited had allocated 2 GW of projects in 2020, while the Indian \nRailways has committed to 20 GW of solar power by 2030. Other PSUs such as NLC India Limited, defence \norgan izations, and governmental establishments are also expected to contribute to this addition.   \n \n\u2022 Rooftop solar projects : CRISIL MI&A -Consulting expects 20 -22 GW of rooftop solar projects (under the \ncapex and opex mode) to be commissioned by fiscal 2029, led by PM Surya Ghar Yojana and industrial and \ncommercial consumers under net/gross metering schemes of various state.   \n \n\u2022 Open -access solar projects : CRISIL MI&A -Consulting expects 13 -15 GW of open -access solar projects \n(under the capex and opex mode) to be commissioned by fiscal 2028, led by green energy open access rules \n2022, sustainability initiatives/RE 100 targets of the corporate consumers, bet ter tariff structures and policies \nof states such as Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, which are more long term in nature.   \n \n\u2022 Push for Green hydrogen : Production for green hydrogen is expected to start from fiscal 2026 with production \nof 0.5 -1 million tonnes of production. The government has set the target production of 5 million tonnes of \ngreen hydrogen by 2030. As per announcement, we expect 2.0 -2.2 MTPA of green hydrogen to commission \nwhich can lead to further upside of solar capacity of 32 -37 GW, by fiscal 2029. However, developers may \ntie-up via grid / open access and not go to the captive route generation under this segment will remain a \nmonitorable.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1Year wise expected solar capacity addition   \n169 \n  \nSource: CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nAlso, the global conglomerate such as Amazon, Microsoft has set their sustainability goals and procuring more \nand more renewable energy in India to set off their global GHG emission. This also provides a lucrative \nopportunity for IPPs to sign PPAs for RE capacity.  \n \nThe European Unions\u2019 (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is the EU's tool to put a fair price \non the carbon emitted during the production of carbon intensive goods that are entering the EU, and to encourage \ncleaner industrial production in non -EU countries. The CBAM is expected to have a significant impact on solar \ncapacity additions in non -EU countries. With increasing adoption of solar energy, CBAM is expected to contribute \nto overall growth of the market. The CBAM is expected to drive the rene wable energy demand for energy intensive \nindustries who export their products in European markets in order to follow their norms regarding carbon emission \nand avoid imposition of penalties for non -adherence to such rules & regulations.  \n \nProgress on T&D infrastructure, interregional transmission capacity  \n \nMarket review  \n \nRobust generation capacity addition over the years and government's focus on 100% rural electrification through \nlast mile connectivity has led t o extensive expansion of the T&D system across the country. The total length of \ndomestic transmission lines rose from 413,407 circuit kilometres (ckm) in fiscal 2019 to 485,544 ckm in fiscal \n2024.  \n \nThere has been strong growth in the transmission system at higher voltage levels and substation capacities. This \nis a result of increased requirement of the transmission network to carry bulk power over longer distances and at \nthe same time optimise the ri ght of way, minimise losses and improve grid reliability.  \n \nThe total transmission line length (above 220 kV) has increased at 3.3% CAGR from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024. \nThis increase can also be attributed to an increase in the commissioning of the 765 -KV lines, growing at a CAGR \nof ~6% over the same period. 765 kV lines have higher transfer capacity and lower technical losses thereby \nreducing the overall number of lines and rights of way required to deliver equivalent capacity. Performance in a \ntransmission line improves as voltage increases and as 765 kV lin es us e one of the highest voltage levels, they \nexperience comparatively lesser amount of line loss. 800 kV lines have also shown strong growth momentum, \nrising at 9.5% CAGR over the last 5 fiscals, majorly owing to strong investments by the central sector.  \n \nInter -regional power transmission capacity of the National Grid has grown strongly from 99,050 MW in fiscal \n2019 to 118,740 MW in fiscal 2024, at a CAGR of 3.7%. Subsequently, transformation capacity rose from 899,663 \nMVA in fiscal 2019 to 1,251,080 MVA in  fiscal 2024, growing at a CAGR of ~6.8%.  \n \nPlans to increase grid infrastructure  914-1516-17 17-1825-26 26-272.5-31.5-2 1-21-1.52-2.5\n2-2.54.5-57.5-810-1210-12\n33.2-32.8-32.6-32.6-33-3.5\n33-43-44-54.5-5.55.5-6.5\n1522-2426-2830-3241-4345-47\nFY24 FY25P FY26P FY27P FY28P FY29P(GW)\nUtility additions Additions from coal plants Green hydrogen Open Access Rooftop Total \n170 \n  \nReport on \u201cTransmission System for Integration of over 500 GW RE Capacity by 2030\u201d published by CEA \nportrays the broad transmission system roadmap for reliable integration of 537 GW RE capacity by the year 2030.  \n \nThe length of the transmission lines and sub -station capacity planned under ISTS for integration of additional \nwind and solar capacity by 2030 has been estimated as 50,890 ckm and 433,575 MVA respectively at an estimated \ncost of Rs 2442 billion.  \nThe present inter -regional transmission capacity is 118,740 MW. With the additional inter -regional transmission \ncorridors under implementation/planned, the cumulative inter -regional transmission capacity is likely to be about \n150,000 MW in 2030  \nFurthermore, central government has planned to achieve 500 GW capacity from non -fossil fuel -based energy \nsources by 2030. Solar and wind will pay a more role in achieving the said target. The share of renewable energy \n(incl. hydro and energy storage) in th e installed capacity mix is expected to reach ~62% in fiscal 2029 from ~43% \nin fiscal 2024.  \n \nSuch multifold expansion plans also require large scale development in transmission sector. This is mainly \nbecause large scale grid connected solar and wind plants are usually located in the far -flung areas, where there is \nlimited existing transmission inf rastructure. Moreover, renewable energy is not well distributed across states and \nis in-firm in nature. Robust transmission planning is required to optimize the high costs, utilization levels and \nlosses associated with transmission system to transmit the p ower generated to load centres is critical.  \n \nFor enabling growth of RE capacity, areas which have high solar and wind energy potential, needs to be connected \nto ISTS, so that the power generated could be evacuated to the load centres.  \n \nMNRE/SECI have identified REZs totaling 181.5 GW for likely benefits by the year 2030. These REZ\u2019s are in \neight states as detailed below:  \n \nCost competitiveness and other advantages of solar power  \n  \nThe sun is the most abundant source of energy on the planet, and it is completely replenishable. Solar energy \nplants do not pollute the environment and take less time to build than wind and hydroelectricity power plants. \nSolar energy plants can be set up a nywhere, especially in country like India where sunshine is almost available \nfor more than 8 -10 months across country.  \nWith Energy storage solutions, solar can become an affordable energy option for round the clock supply.  \n \nComparison of solar with different energy sources  \nParameter  Solar  Wind  Hydro  Biomass  Coal  \nUtilization Factor  ~20-25% ~25% -30% ~40-45% 70-80% 80-85% \nClean energy  Yes Yes Yes No No \nTime to construct  Less Moderate  More  Moderate  More  \nInitial Cost  Moderate  High  Very high  High  High  \nO&M Cost  Low High  Low Moderate  Moderate  \nImpact of \nenvironment  Low Medium  High  Medium  High  \nWater requirement \nfor \ncleaning/cooling \npurpose  Low NA NA Medium  High  \nSource: Industry, CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \n \nKey challenges/bottlenecks in solar power development  \n  \nNotwithstanding the high potential of solar energy, it is mired with some challenges. Overcoming these challenges \nwill be critical for the successful implementation of solar projects.  \n \nAvailability of contiguous parcels of land:  With rapid capacity additions and intense competition, it becomes \nimperative for developers to acquire land at competitive costs and in areas with high levels of solar irradiance. \nThe 40 GW solar park scheme, which provides land to successful bidders for s etting up of the projects, is \nfacilitative in this aspect.  \n \nAdequacy of evacuation infrastructure : Grid integration of renewables is key to the sector's growth. Instances of  \n171 \n delay in readiness of transmission infrastructure at solar parks have caused concern among developers. However, \nan aggressive roadmap to add an incremental ~100 GW via new schemes and existing available capacity to the \ngrid should be adequate for the expec ted solar capacity additions\u2019 timely execution is critical  \n \nAvailability of low -cost capital : With the emergence of several large players in the sector, scale, and experience \nhave aided fund -raising to an extent, especially with the backing of several foreign investors. However, after \nfactoring in the weak rupee, the conservative risk appetite of l enders, and other added cost pressures, it is \nimperative for developers to maintain prudent capital management over the long term. To mitigate these factors, \ndevelopers have been tapping alternative/new routes to raise mon ey from time to time.  \nFurthermore, the other key monitorables are deterioration in the financial profile of distribution utilities resulting \nin offtake issues and payment defaults, declining power deficit, and aggressive bidding.  \n \nProject capex and O&M cost movements  \n \nEPC cost, Rs million/ MWp  \n \nSource: Industry, CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \nNote: EPC cost for utility scale projects is estimated using imported mono -crystalline modules in a fixed tilt layout \nand central inverters. EPC cost for rooftop solar systems is estimated for a typical industrial installation on a \nmetal roof.  \n \nSolar project CAPEX trend has largely followed global module price trends. On the O&M front, costs have \ndecreased by around 30% in the last 3 -4 years to around Rs 0.18 -0.25 Mn/MW/annum due to experience gained \nby service providers coupled with technology a doption including robotic cleaning.  \n \nExpected investment in solar segment  \n \nCRISIL MI&A Consulting foresees a surge in solar power capacity, reaching 125 -130 GW from fiscal years 2025 \nto 2029, significantly surpassing the 50 -55 GW added between fiscal years 2019 and 2024. This growth is \nprimarily spurred by robust government backi ng, demonstrated through an aggressive tendering strategy. Key \ncatalysts include technological advancements (e.g., floating solar and module efficiency), affordable financing, \nand supportive policies. Nevertheless, escalating component prices and added tax es may elevate capital \nexpenditures, affecting the willingness of state discoms to procure solar power.  \n \nCRISIL MI&A Consulting expects consolidation to continue with the ongoing quest for a larger portfolio among \nbig players and several smaller firms exiting the sector due to increased competition. CRISIL MI&A Consulting \nestimates investment requirements to the tune of Rs. 8 -8.5 trillion over fiscals 2025 to 2029 as compared to Rs \n3.5-3.6 trillion over fiscals 2019 to 2024.  \n \nExpected investments in the solar energy generation sector in India  38.8 40.246.443.340.236.532.6\n27.7 27.3 27.3 26.644.8 46.252.449.346.242.538.6\n33.7 33.3 33.3 32.6\nQ4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1\n2024eQ2\n2024e\nUtility scale solar Rooftop solar \n172 \n  \nSource: Industry, CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \n \nOverview of Wind sector in India  \n \nEvolution of Wind Power in India  \n \nIndia has a vast wind energy potential, estimated at 695.5 GW at 120 meters above ground level (AGL) as per \nestimates by the National Institute of Wind Energy.  \n \nIndia has the fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world, with ~47 GW as of 30th September 2024. \nWind power accounted for nearly 10.5% of India's total installed utility power generation capacity. India\u2019s wind \npower installed capacity increased at a CAGR of approximately 7% from 26.8 GW in Fiscal 2016 to 47.4 GW in \nFiscal 2025 (As of September 2024). Wind power capacity is mainly spread across the southern, western, and \nnorthwestern states of India. Leading states in wind power installations include Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, \nRajasthan, and Karnataka. Wind capacity additions  \n \nWind power has witnessed a healthy capacity addition of ~1.48 GW in six months of fiscal 2025 vis -a-vie ~3.25 \nGW in Fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2023, ~2.28 GW wind power capacity was installed on the back of commissioning \nunder several schemes that have been pe nding - SECI Tranche IV, V and VI. The rising trend of hybrid power \n(solar plus wind) projects coupled with moderation and stabilisation in key commodity prices has also supported \ngrowth.  \n \nState -wise wind capacity additions (MW)  \n \n Source: MNRE, CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nThe top five states (Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra) make up ~84% of the installed wind \ncapacity (as of 31 March 2024),  with some regions within these states accounting for most wind power projects. \nSince April 2021, ~80% the new ca pacity additions have happened in 3 states \u2013 Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and \nKarnataka.  \n \nThe weighted average discovered tariffs for allocated capacity of competitively bid projects for FY24 is Rs \n3.4/kWh as against Rs. 3.1 -3.3/kWh tariff required for earning 10 -13% equity IRRs.

Round the Clock \nrenewable energy (RTC -RE) project is a form of supply that combines storage system such as battery energy \nstorage system or PSP with Solar, Wind or Hydro to meet a demand at a desired availability and cost. However, \nincremental challenges pertaining to wind -site/land availability, grid connectivity, and viability at low tariffs due \nto elevated capital cost pose challenges for the sector.  \n \nLed by India's ambitious clean energy targets declared under NDC, focus on clean segments such as wind is \nexpected to continue coupled with a healthy pipeline existing in the segment. The government policy to tender 10 \nGW wind capacity annually till fiscal  2028 will further boost the capacity additions. The Central Government is \nalso contemplating for renewable generation obligation (RGO) mandating thermal power generators to generate \ncertain % of their additional capacity from renewable energy. Capacity ad ditions over the long term will also be \ndriven by increased hybrid tenders, storage and new business model -based tenders. Central government \nallocations under relatively strong off -takers such as SECI and PTC, reduces risk and would support developer \ninterest. State allocation, on the other hand, has slowed as several states have instead signed power sale agreements \n(PSAs) with PTC and SECI for procurement of wind power to help fulfil their non -renewable purchase obligation \ntargets.  \n \nConsidering above, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting expects wind power capacity additions to remain at ~34 -36 GW \nover fiscals 2025 -2029, higher than the ~10 GW seen over fiscals 2018 -2023.  \n \nExpected annual wind power capacity additions  \n \nSource: CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \n \nKey factors to drive wind energy capacity additions  \n \nNew tender opportunities  \n \nNew opportunities have emerged in the wind sector in India with SECI tendering projects including hybrid, round -\nthe-clock, peak power supply and FDRE projects, all of which require a mix of resources, including wind.  \n \nImproved technology  \n \nNewer wind turbines are being launched that have higher rated capacity and higher hub height (120 -140 m), \nwhich can be set up at low -quality wind sites. Technological advancements have allowed players to set up \nwindmills in states/sites with lower wind de nsity.

MNRE has outlined \nfurther plans to tender 10 GW  of capacity each year  by RE Implementing Agencies (like SECI, NTPC, NHPC, \nSJVN). This bodes well as central sector PPAs have lower counterparty risk compared with PPAs directly with \ndiscoms. The latter are known to delay payments to developers and have poor financial ratings, while SECI and \nPTC are better rated and provide various payment security mechanisms (LCs, payment security fund and SECI, \nNTPC, NHPC, SJVN being party to the tripartite agreement).  \n \nMajor payment security mechanisms to de -risk investment in renewable energy inter - alia include Letter of Credit \n(LC); Payment Security Funds and Tripartite Agreement (TPA) between Ministry of Power, RBI and State \nGovernment (if applicable). These instrume nts are invoked in case of delays/default in payment to Renewable \nEnergy Generating Companies and have been further strengthened by the notification of the Late Payment \nSurcharge Rules, 2022.  \n \nUpward revision in RPO targets  \n \nThe MoP provided a new RPO long -term trajectory for wind energy till fiscal 2030 which proposes target \nof 0.67%  for wind in fiscal 2025, increasing consecutively to 3.48% in fiscal 2030 for wind.  \n \nRevised Wind RPO trajectory  \n \nSource: MoP; CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nMost states in India have set lower RPO targets  (pan-India avg. non -solar RPO target in fiscal 2023  is 8.9% vs \n10.50% required as per MoP),  resulting in higher compliance vis -\u00e0-vis the set targets. To meet the increased \ntargets, states would have to procur e more RE either via the REC route (which still leads to capacity additions) or \nvia competitive bid out capacities. Waiver of ISTS charges by CERC for all projects set up until fiscal 2025  also \nenables states with low RE potential to procure from more able  states. However, RPO compliance is dependent \non strict enforcement by regulatory authorities. Amendment to the Electricity Act, 2003 has been proposed to \ninclude stricter provisions on penalty for non -compliance; however, this is yet to be passed.  \n \nAccelerated depreciation  \n \nHistorically, particularly in fiscals 2015 and 2016, accelerated depreciation (AD) had been a key driver for \ncapacity additions. However, going forward, CRISIL expects capacity additions under this mode to be restricted \nonly to large conglomerates in other unrelated businesses but seeking tax breaks. While AD was halved  to 40% \nfrom April 2017 onwards, it will continue to support additions in open -access segment.  \n \nHigh industrial tariffs in select states  0.67%1.45%1.97%2.45%2.95%3.48%\nFY25 FY26 FY27 FY28 FY29 FY30 \n175 \n  \nIn states  such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, where industrial tariffs are high (Rs 6 -\n6.5/unit),  wind power is an attractive option since generation cost is about Rs 3.0 -4.0/kWh. Capacity can be set \nup via the open -access mode, i.e ., bilateral agreements directly with consumers such as commercial/industrial \nentities.  \n \nMovement of the project capital costs and O&M costs  \n \nIncrease in prices  for key commodities (4% and 26% y -o-y rise in cement and steel prices, respectively,  in fiscal \n2022 and further increase of ~3% and 4% in fiscal 2023), along with supply chain disruptions due to Russia -\nUkraine crisis, contributed  to cost  escalations and higher capital cost for wind projects. Further, the shift in trend \nof larger size turbines of over 3 MW has further increased cost pressures. In fact, the commodity price surge has \nbeen one of the principal reasons for stagnation of growth  in the industry as it has translated into lower project \nreturns, which has impacted project commissioning  since the second half of fiscal 2022. CRISIL MI&A -\nConsulting expects key commodity prices to reduce by 5 -7% during fiscal 2025. This is expected to r educe the \ncapital costs by 2 -3%. \n \nExpected investment in wind segment  \n \nCRISIL MI&A Consulting expects wind power capacity additions to grow over the next few years, mostly driven \nby green hydrogen, central and state allocations, and a pent -up pipeline. The previous change in the bidding \nmechanism has caused a slowdown in the industry due to a significant fall in tariffs, where both bid response and \nprofitability for OEMs have dropped, however, new bidding guidelines along and increased tendering till FY28 \nto boost prospects in the sector. CRISIL MI&A Consulting expects wind ca pacity additions of 34 -36 GW over \nfiscals 2025 -29, entailing investments of ~Rs 2.75 -3.0 trillion over the period.  \n \nExpected investments in the wind energy generation sector in India  \n \nSource: CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \n \nOverview of Wind Solar Hybrid sector  \n \nOverview of Indian wind solar hybrid market  \n \nWSH is fast becoming the preferred RE option in India. Although the MNRE has not yet set a generation target, \nthe nascent sector has received strong support from SECI and several state governments. There are two types of \nWSH projects \u2014 pure-play ones and t hose with storage. There are also projects that may come up under the \ngovernment\u2019s RTC power scheme, which has a mandatory 51:49 blend of RE and thermal.  \n \nIndia has introduced RTC generation tenders, including hybrid tenders to strengthen clean generation combining \nsolar, wind and storage technologies. The MNRE introduced the National Wind -Solar Hybrid Policy on May 14, \n2018. The main objective of the policy  is to provide a framework for the promotion of large grid -connected wind -\nsolar PV hybrid systems and efficient utilisation of transmission infrastructure and land. It also aims to reduce the \nvariability in renewable power generation and achieve better gri d stability. As on April 30, 2024, hybrid projects \nof aggregate capacity 15022.82 MW are under construction in the country. It is expected that India will witness \n15-17 GW of WSH capacity addition in the next five years (fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2029), of whi ch around 6 -7 GW \nwill be from wind.  0.4 -0.50.5 -0.6 0.5 -0.60.7 -0.80.8 -0.9\nFY25 FY26 FY27 FY28 FY29(Rs. Tn) \n176 \n  \nKey growth drivers  \n \nWind Solar Hybrid segment in India is experiencing rapid growth, driven by several key factors:   \n \n\u2022 Potential:  India has around 696 GW (120 m hub height) wind potential and around 750 GW of solar potential. \nCurrently only around 10% of the potential is developed and balance 90% of the potential yet to be exploited. \nThis provides huge opportunities for wind and sol ar development.   \n \n\u2022 Geographical advantages : India\u2019s coastline provides high wind speed as well as excellent solar potential. \nState such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh have excellent wind as well \nsolar potential.  Such an advantage provides a great opportunity for hybridisation. Depending on the project \nrequirements, the hybrid projects can be co -located or located in different locations also making it more \nflexible even if natural resources are located in different  places.   \n \n\u2022 Complementary resources:  Wind and solar sources complement each other. Due to their inherent \ncharacteristics, they generate power during different times of the day as well as seasons. Wind power is at its \nmaximum during nighttime whereas solar power is available only during the d ay. Therefore, for 24X7 supply, \nthey complement each other and hence WSH projects provide more reliable power and can be used for round -\nthe-clock (RTC) supply.   \n \n\u2022 Resource optimisation:  Co-located WSH plants can help in resource optimisation. With optimum land \nutilisation and infrastructure sharing, the wind and solar resources can be optimally utilised leading to better \nCUF as well as cost optimisation. With energy storage facilities, th e WSH plants help in better grid \nmanagement and higher penetration of renewable energy into existing power systems.   \n \n\u2022 Policy push:  Government of India\u2019s policy push has also helped the WSH segment. With increased ROP \ntargets, VGF funding, PLI schemes, solar park schemes, simplified land allocation has helped both the \nresources (wind and solar) to thrive.  \n \nConstraints in setting up hybrid power plants  \n \nLack of good sites  \n \nWSH projects require wind and solar plants to be co -located to inject power into the same pooling station. This \nmeans the ideal location should have good irradiation and experience high wind speeds. But such locations are \nhard to find, especially as all major windy areas with strong grid evacuation facilities have bee n saturated. Hence, \nthe industry has demanded that wind and solar plants of a WSH project be allowed to operate from different \nlocations. This will also help bring down tariffs owing to better plant optimization levels. The only advantage of \nco-location is  better optimization of transmission infrastructure. However, CRISIL MI&A Consulting believes \nthe advantage from reduced tariff (when wind and solar units are located separately) is much higher than the \nbenefit of improved transmission capacity optimizatio n (with co -location).  \n \nGrid balancing requirement poses implementation risks  \n \nDevelopers are required to balance the grid before injecting electricity generated from a co -located WSH plant. \nThis means they need to simulate the ideal wind and solar generation mix from the plant, in order to optimize the \nhybrid curve. This may lead to additional implementation risks for a developer.  \n \nOptimal sizing  \n \nThe size of the WSH plant differs from state to state depending on the resource availability. Optimal sizing of \nstorage is also a pertinent question. Overloading or oversizing may lead to underutilisation during the peak \ngeneration period (daytime in summe rs or night -time in monsoons) resulting in storage capacity remaining \nunutilised or idle.  \nHigher tariff   \n177 \n  \nThe average tariff for WSH projects is Rs 3.15 -3.20 per kWh today \u2014 higher than solar tariff, which has dropped \nto Rs 2.55 -2.56 per kWh in recent bids, and comparable to wind tariff, which has remained sticky at Rs 3.40 -3.75 \nper kWh. And although cross -subsidising costly wind power with low -cost solar will provide some price cushion \nat the lower end, the pricing needs to be attractive to make WSH competitive.  \n \nReview of Large hydro Power generation in India  \n \nOverview of historical hydro capacity additions  \n \nIn the last 6 years (fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2024) India has added only ~2,450 MW large hydro capacity. Central \nsector has led the capacity additions with commissioning of 600 MW of Kameng HEP, 330 MW Kishanganga \nfollowed by Private sector with 99 MW of Sing oli Bhatwari HEP, 100 MW Sorang HEP, 180 MW Bajoli Holi \nHEP, 113 MW of Rongnichu HEP. No capacity has been added as of September 2024 in fiscal 2025.  \n \nAnnual hydro capacity addition  \n \nSource: MoP, CEA, CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \n \nThe reassessment study (regarding basin -wise reassessment of hydroelectric potential in the country) was carried \nout by CEA during the period 2017 -23. As per the study, the assessed hydropower potential from major / medium \nschemes (i.e., schemes having capacit y above 25 MW) is about 133.4 GW. As of March 2024, 46.93 GW (35%) \nhas been developed and 18.08 GW (13.6%) is under construction out of 133.4 GW of potential.  \nPresently 38 no. of hydroelectric project (above 25 MW) totalling to 15,273.50 MW are under implementation. \nOut of these, 29 no. HEPs totalling to 14,037.5 MW are under active construction and 9 no. HEPs totalling to \n1236 MW are presently stalled.  \n \nAssessment of current support policies and issues in hydro power sector  \n \n\u2022 Declaring Large Hydro Power (LHPs) (> 25 MW projects) as renewable energy source:  To accelerate the \ngrowth of hydropower in the country, the MoP has set a target of 30 GW hydro capacity addition by 2030. In \nMarch 2019, MoP has declared Large Hydro Power Plants (LHPs) with the installed capacity > 25 MW as a \nrenewable energy source.  \n \n\u2022 Putting in place a Hydro Purchase Obligation (HPO):  The MoP has set separate HPO targets. As per the \nMoP Notification dated 20th October 2023, the HPO targets range from 0.38% in fiscal 2025 to 1.33% in \nfiscal 2030.  \n \n\u2022 Tariff rationalization measures for bringing down hydro power tariff:  Tariff rationalization measures \nincluding providing flexibility to the developers to determine tariff by back loading of tariff after increasing \nproject life to 40 years, increasing debt repayment period to 18 years, and introducing escalating tariff of 2% . \n \n\u2022 Budgetary support towards cost of enabling infrastructure, i.e., roads/bridges:  The budgetary support for \nEnabling Infrastructure i.e., roads/ bridges for Hydropower projects would be provided by the MoP. The limit \nof this budgetary support would be Rs. 15 million per MW for projects up to 200 MW and Rs. 10 million per \nMW for project s above 200 MW with construction starting after March 2019.  \n 815 \n106 300 510 513 \n128 78 \nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24(MW) \n178 \n \u2022 Waiver of ISTS charges : 100% ISTS charges waiver for new hydro power projects in which construction \nwork is awarded and PPA is signed on or before 30 June 2025. Subsequently, part waiver of ISTS charges, \nin steps of 25% from 01.07.2025 to 01.07.2028, has been extended for HEPs fo r which construction work is \nawarded and PPA is signed up to 30.06.2028.  \n \nOutlook on hydro capacity additions in India  \n \nCRISIL MI&A Consulting expects 11 -12 GW of hydro power capacities to be commissioned (out of 14 GW \npresently under construction) over fiscals 2025 -29 as against ~2.5  GW added during fiscals 2018 -24. CRISIL \nMI&A Consulting further believes the central sector (NHPC and NTPC) will lead capacity additions in hydro \npower  with 4 -5 GW additions, followed by the state sector ( Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, \nUttarakhand) amounting to 2 -3 GW and about 3 GW would be installed by other JV utilities such as SJVN, THDC, \netc. Several private projects with aggregate capacity of 390 MW are also in the advance stages of con struction \nand are expected to get commissioned by fiscal 2026.  \n \nInvestments by hydro power giant NHPC rose by a staggering 52% to Rs 108.57 billion in fiscal 2024 from the \nrevised estimates of Rs 71.29 billion for fiscal 2023. This is expected  to provide the much -needed push to hasten \nthe completion of hydro projects.  \n \nExpected annual hydro capacity additions  \n \nSource: CEA; CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \n \nKey issues/ challenges in hydro power projects in India  \n \nThe development of hydro power projects faces difficulties in land acquisition, lack of infrastructural facilities \nlike road and communication, environment and forest issues, resettlement and rehabilitation problems, paucity of \nfunds, longer gestation period, geological surprises, inter -state aspects,  non-availability of hydrological data, \nsecurity restrictions in border areas, lack of adequate skilled manpower and contractual problems.  \n \nHydropower projects involve submergence causing the displacement of project area people. The rehabilitation of \nproject affected people is also a major issue. Further, getting forest and environment clearances also delays the \nproject. Many hydropower projec ts with common river systems between adjoining states are held up due to a lack \nof inter -state agreements and disputes on water -sharing.  \n \nHydro projects require higher upfront costs to address greater complexities in design, engineering, environmental \nand social impact mitigation, etc. Most hydro projects take at least 5 -6 years to construct which increases the \ninterest during construction. Although the operating cost of hydro projects are minimal, and the project life is \nlonger but there are other multiple factors that make hydropower difficult to finance. The technical challenges in \nhydropower development often result in time and cost overr un, posing additional risks for financiers. Delay in \ncash inflows increase uncertainty and risks, resulting in higher risk premium on financing charges.  \n \nHydropower projects are mostly located in remote areas which do not have adequate demand for electricity. This \ncreates the requirement for developing enabling infrastructure for power evacuation. It also requires the \ndevelopment of associated infrastructur e such as roads and bridges in the area.  \n \nOverview of Small Hydro sector  \n 1.0-1.5 1.0-1.55.0-5.5\n2.0-2.5\n1.0-1.5\nFY25 FY26 FY27 FY28 FY29(GW) \n179 \n Hydro Power projects are classified as large and small hydro projects based on their sizes. In India, Hydro Power \nplants with capacity of 25 MW or below are classified as Small Hydro. As per MNRE, the estimated potential of \nsmall / mini hydel projects is 2 1,133 MW from 7,133 sites for power generation. Of the total 21.1 GW of potential, \nover 60% lies in these five states namely, Karnataka, Himachal, Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and \nUttarakhand which includes over 45% of the total 7,133 sites.  \nAs of September, 2024, the installed capacity of SHP is 5075.75 MW. In the last 5 -6 years only ~483 MW of \ncapacity was added at a CAGR of ~1.9%. Of the total potential, only 26% has been tapped so far.  \n \nInstalled capacity of SHP  \n \n*As pf September 2024, Source: CEA; CRISIL MI&A Consulting  \n \nChallenges in the small hydro power sector  \n \nSHPs are environmentally friendly as they do not encounter the problems of large -scale land \nacquisition/deforestation and displacement of human settlements. Being located in remote locations and at the tail \nend of the transmission network, they help in imp roving voltage levels and can also feed into the local grid in case \nof a major grid failure, thereby avoiding complete black out. They improve the socio -economic condition of the \nadjoining areas as well as a large chunk of the investment made in the projec t feeds into the local economy. \nMoreover, Micro Hydel Projects (MHP) and Watermills also have the potential to meet the power requirements \nof remote areas, helping the local people in developing small scale industries.  \n \nDespite various benefits, SHP projects in general faces various implementation challenges. Developing an SHP \ninvolves complex procedures and requires diligent steps to decide the site, unit size and generating equipment. \nMany SHPs are scrapped due to low c onsumption of electricity and sometimes very small size SHP adversely \naffect the plant\u2019s viability. Usually, the life span of SHP is 35 \u201350 years but some SHPs are closed down even \nbefore the end of the expected life due to faults in design and construction , obsolete equipment or non -availability \nof grid extension.  \n \nThe river flow changes with season thus, measurement of flow rate should be carried out throughout the year in \norder to obtain proper discharge data. However, the absence of genuine data causes improper estimate of the \npower potential. Sedimentation is another issue that is often faced in developing hydropower projects. Absence \nof geological and sedimentation data has resulted in wrong design and caused  closure of many hydropower \nprojects. Problems are faced in acquiring land due to delays in obtaining permission from community or from \ngovernment department like forest and environment.  \n \nEnergy storage  \n \nOverview of energy storage technologies  \n \nEnergy storage technologies can be broadly divided into four segments \u2013 mechanical, electromechanical, \nchemical, and thermal storage. However, only a few technologies are available on a commercial scale worldwide. \nTechnologies such as pumped hydro storage (PHS), lithium, and sodium batteries are available commercially and \nare being used for different applications. Other technologies such as compressed air, flywheel, thermal and \nhydrogen storage, have yet to demonstrate their commercial viability at scale.  \n \nPumped Hydro Storage Project (PHSP) is the most widely used and commercially available means of energy \nstorage technology in India. However, the total installed capacity of PHSP is minuscule (~4% of the exploitable \npotential) in the country.  \n \nPumped hydro storage projects in India  \n 4.494.59 4.684.79 4.85 4.94 5.00 5.08\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25*(GW) \n180 \n Potential of PHS in India  \n \nThe identified potential of PHS in the country is about 124 GW (comprising 114 PHSP). However, the operational \ncapacity of PHSP is merely 4.7 GW, which indicates the large potential growth in this segment.  \n \nOverview of PHS projects in India  \n \nAs on August 2024, India has an installed capacity of 4.75 GW of on -river pumped storage projects in operation. \nCurrently, out of the 8 pumped storage schemes with aggregate installed capacity of 4.75 GW, only 6 schemes \nwith aggregate installed capacity of  3.31 GW are being operated in pumping mode.  \nThere has been limited traction for PHS projects which is evident in tendering activities. As compared to RE \nsources, the tendering for PHS projects is very low. PHS projects have their own challenges which is also reflected \nin negligible capacity addition  in last 5 -6 years, largely on account of limitations in identification of suitable sites, \nrelatively complex implementation, long gestation period and high capital cost that make viability a major issue. \nThe guidelines released by the MoP in April 2023 wi ll address many of these issues. However, traction in PHS \nprojects will depend on steps to make tariffs attractive to discoms and mitigate implementation risk to fuel private \nsector participation.  \nPHS projects with aggregate capacity of 66,000 MW, are at different stages of development and are distributed \namong 12 States as shown in the below figure. Of these, over 60% of capacity is expected to be installed in two \nstates, namely, Andhra Pradesh and  Maharashtra.  \n \nState wise total PHS capacity at different stages of development as of August -2024  \n \nSource: CEA, CRISIL MI&A -Consulting  \n \nBattery energy storage  \n \nBattery Energy Storage  Systems (BESS) is another form of storage technology which has gained traction in the \nlast few years. It has a very high energy density, making it appropriate to offer ancillary services. More \nimportantly, BESS can be installed easil y, requires less time for setup, and can be used for a wide range of grid \nsupport activities, such as energy time shift, distribution deferral, and energy arbitrage etc. The technology is yet \nto achieve its full potential to provide grid support services, and comes with high investment cost and changing \ntechnology, and therefore has associated risks. Further, batteries would require replacement or disposal after 10-\n12 years, depending upon usage  and type of technology . \n \nComparison of PHS vs BESS  \n \nA comparative analysis of PHS and BESS technology is mentioned below : \n \nComparison of PHS and BESS  \nParameters  PHS  BESS  \nCapital cost  Total capital cost for a closed loop \nPHS ranges around ~Rs. 50 -60 Mn/ \nMW*  Lithium -ion battery storage can range from \nUSD 550-700/kW (for a four -hour storage \nsolution)  \nEfficiency  75-80% 80-85% \nLand requirement  ~2,000 m2/MW  ~100 m2/MW  \nIdeal storage duration  6 \u2013 12 hours  Upto 4 hours  \nResponse time  30-90 seconds  In milliseconds  19.2 18.4\n11.5\n5.63.92.6 1.81.0 1.0 1.0 0.6Maharashtra\nAndhra Pradesh\nUttar Pradesh\nRajasthan\nKarnataka\nMadhya Pradesh\nChhattisgarh\nGujarat\nUttarakhand\nWest Bengal\nOdisha(GW) \n181 \n Parameters  PHS  BESS  \nProject life  40 \u2013 50 years (life of dam/reservoir is \nover 80 years)  10-12 years  \nConstruction period  4 \u2013 5 years, it also depends upon other \nexternal and socio -political factors  1 year  \nOperating cost  Lower  Higher since batteries need to be replaced \nafter certain period  \nEstimated levelised tariff  Rs 4 \u2013 6 per kWh  Rs 5 \u2013 7 per kWh  \nEnvironmental impact  Need substantial reservoirs which may \ncause environmental consequences, \nsuch as habitat destruction and \nchanges in water flow downstream  Disposal of batteries is a major concern.

These measures are expected to expedite the \ndeployment of storage systems and thereby  accelerating the growth of India\u2019s RE capacity. MNRE in its RE \nbidding guidelines provided the option to the RE developer to tie up with energy storage system developers to \nmeet the project parameters to provide firm and dispatchable RE power.  \n \nPumped hydro  projects  \n \nPumped storage is a proven technology and has been in use for decades to support/balance grids. Unlike other \nstorage technologies, performance of PHS is quite reliable on long term basis. PHS offers energy storage of 6 to \n \n182 \n 12 hours. PHS offers energy storage of 6 to 12 hours which is well suited for energy -shifting applications, wherein \nexcess RE generation can be shifted to peak demand periods of late evenings. The long project life of PHS has \nthe potential to provide a sta ble and consistent cash inflow for about 40 years. This healthy cash -flow profile \nenables favourable project financing arrangements for PHS, such as lower loan rates and a higher debt -equity \nratio.  \n \nFor PHS projects, several provisions are proposed to facilitate the allocation and development of PHS under the \nguidelines such as no upfront premium for project allocation, monetization of ancillary services, and participation \nin all market segments. Fina ncial institutions are expected to provide long -term loans with competitive rates, and \ntax and duty incentives are provided to encourage development. States may reimburse State Goods and Services \nTax (SGST) on hydropower project components, provide exempti ons in stamp duty and registration fees for land, \nand offer land on an annual lease rent basis. The guidelines also mandated using green finance like sovereign \nbonds or concessional climate finance for funding such projects.  \n \nTo speed up the clearance process, CEA has also established a Single Window Clearance Cell for approval of \nPHSPs. Additionally, MoP has provided budgetary support of Rs. 10 Mn/MW (for projects above 200 MW) and \nRs. 15 Mn/MW (for projects below 200 MW and u p to 25 MW) for the construction of roads and bridges for \nhydropower projects (including PHS projects) whose construction started after March 2019.  \n \nBattery energy storage projects  \n \nBESS can be used for multiple applications such as voltage and frequency regulation, spinning reserves, peak \nshaving. With rising R&D and subsequent improvement in technology as well as increasing scale, cost \ncompetitiveness of such solutions to improve. F or batteries, a special consideration is degradation. Batteries \ndegrade as they age, decreases the amount of capacity they can store. The expected life of the batteries is about \n10 to 1 2 years (depending on the technology and how the batteries are operated ). By the end of that time, the \nbatteries\u2019 capacity is expected to be reduced to less than 70% of their original capacity.  \n \nIn September 2023, the government approved the VGF scheme for development of 4000 MWh of BESS capacity \nby fiscal 2031. An initial outlay of Rs.94 billion including budgetary support of Rs.37.60 billion has been provided \nunder the scheme. The VGF would be p rovided from fiscal 2024 -26 and will be capped at 40% of the capital cost. \nPrior to VGF scheme, the Ministry of Heavy Industries in June 2021 launched a PLI scheme for Advance \nChemistry Cell battery storage of 50 GWh capacity with an outlay of Rs. 181 bill ion, which includes more than \n10 GWh grid -scale battery storage. The Scheme expects direct investment of around Rs. 450 billion in ACC \nBattery storage manufacturing projects. As of December 2023, out of 50 GWh capacity, 30 GWh capacity has \nalready been all otted through competitive bidding process.  \n \nUsage of battery storage is expected to be strong across the generation, transmission, and distribution segments \nas well as at the consumer end. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has also forecasted a fall in the price \nof storage solutions, especial ly lithium -ion technology. With the greater adoption of lithium -ion battery storage, \nimprovement in battery efficiency, and large -scale manufacturing, CRISIL MI&A Consulting expects the four -\nhour utility -scale lithium -ion battery costs to decrease to $90 -100 per kWh in 2030 from the costs of $130 -140 \nper kWh in 2023.  \n \nWith the announcement of several large -scale PHS projects across the country, the PHS segment is also expected \nto witness significant adoption. According to the CEA\u2019s report on optimum power generation mix study in April \n2023, India will require at least 4 1.7 GW/208 GWh of BESS and 18.9 GW of PHS by fiscal 2030.  \n \nLarge scale ESS tenders  \n \nAs RE penetration scales up, ESS is expected to play a critical role.  \nSECI issued its first 1200 MW RE+storage tender with guaranteed peak power supply of 6 hours per day which \nconcluded in 2020. The two bidders, Greenko (900 MW at peak tariff of ~ Rs 6.12/kWh) with pumped hydro \nstorage and ReNew Power (300 MW at peak tariff  of Rs 6.85/kWh) with BESS were awarded the project. The \nfirst FDRE tender of 1500 MW conducted by SJVN in November 2023 witnessed the lowest tariff of Rs 4.38/kWh.  \n \nAlso, a few large -scale standalone ESS tenders were also issued by SECI, NTPC, GUVNL, MSEDCL in the last \ntwo years. In terms of ESS technology, SECI\u2019s tender was for BESS. However, NTPC\u2019s tender was technology \nagnostic with the requirement of six hours of energy supply. JSW Energy won 500 MW in SECI\u2019s tender and 300 \nMW in PCKL\u2019s tender, whereas Greenko won the NTPC tender and 700 MW in PCKL tender. MSEDCL has also  \n183 \n awarded 2 GW of PHS project each to Torrent Power and JSW in September 2024 which would supply power for \n8 hours per day with a maximum of 5 continuous hours.  \n \nAs of September 2024,  ~12 GW of grid-scale ESS capacity has been  tendered of which ~8 GW has been awarded.  \n \nA confluence of these initiatives indicates the large potential and keen interest from project developers in the ESS \nsegment. Moreover, the results of these tenders also indicate the commercial competitiveness of ESS and RE+ESS \nas compared to electricity s ources.  \n \nA list of recently concluded storage tenders are mentioned below:  \n \nRecently concluded storage tenders  \nSr. No.  Tender name  Tender type  Capacity \n(MW/MWh)  Result \ndate Lowest bid  Winners  \n1.

Green hydrogen is considered a clean and sustainable energy carrier.  \n \nNational Green Hydrogen Mission  \n \nGreen hydrogen mission and policy  \n \nThe National Green Hydrogen Mission was approved by the government on January 4, 2022. The mission aims \nto make India a leading producer and supplier of green hydrogen in the world. The mission would result in \ndevelopment of green hydrogen production capac ity of at least 5 million metric tonne per annum with an \nassociated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country. As per Central Government, the \ntargets by 2030 are likely to bring in over Rs. 8 trillion investments.  \nThe initial outlay for the Mission is Rs.197.44 billion, including an outlay of Rs.174.9 billion for the Strategic \nInterventions for Green Hydrogen Transition Programme (SIGHT) programme, Rs.14.66 billion for pilot projects, \nRs.4 billion for R&D, and Rs. 3 .88 billion towards other Mission components. Under the SIGHT, two distinct \nfinancial incentive mechanisms have been proposed, one is targeting domestic manufacturing of electrolysers and \nthe other for production of Green Hydrogen. The Mission will also su pport pilot projects in emerging end -use \nsectors and production pathways.  \n \nKey highlights of green hydrogen policy  \n \nSome of the key highlights of Green Hydrogen Policy are as follows:  \n\u2022 The waiver of inter -state transmission charges shall be granted for a period of 25 years for Green Hydrogen \nand Green Ammonia projects commissioned before 31st December 2030 . \n\u2022 Developers can manufacture Green Hydrogen/Green Ammonia using Renewable Energy from co -located or \nremotely located plants, or from the Power Exchange. They will be granted Open Access within 15 days of a \ncomplete application. Open Access charges will be in  accordance with the Rules.  \n\u2022 Banking permitted for a period of 30 days for renewable energy used for making Green Hydrogen /Green \nAmmonia.  \n\u2022 Under the Electricity (Transmission system planning, development, and recovery of Inter State Transmission \ncharges) Rules 2021, renewable energy projects set up to manufacture green hydrogen/green ammonia will \nbe granted priority for ISTS connectivity.  \n\u2022 Land in Renewable Energy Parks can be allotted for the manufacture of Green Hydrogen / Green Ammonia.  \n\u2022 Manufacturers of green hydrogen/ammonia can set up bunkers near ports to store green ammonia for export \nor use by shipping. Port authorities will provide land for storage at applicable charges.  \n\u2022 Renewable energy used to produce green hydrogen /ammonia counts towards RPO compliance for consumer \nand the discom in whose area the project is located.  \n\u2022 Distribution licensees may also procure and supply Renewable Energy to the manufacturers of Green \nHydrogen / Green Ammonia in their States. In such cases, the Distribution licensee shall only charge the cost \nof procurement as well as the wheeling charges a nd a small margin as determined by the State Commission.  \n\u2022 MNRE to create a single portal for all Green Hydrogen/Ammonia clearances. All clearances will be provided \nwithin a period of 30 days from date of application.  \n \nStorage and transportation of hydrogen  \n \nChallenges in storage and transportation of hydrogen  \n \nHydrogen is a promising energy carrier that has the potential to decarbonize various sectors. However, the storage \nand transportation of hydrogen pose significant challenges due to its unique properties. The challenges include \nlow energy density, material compatibility issues, compression and liquefaction energy losses, temperature \nsensitivity, high storage costs, safety requirements, and purity requirements. To store hydrogen, it must be \ncompressed or liquefied, which requires high -pressure tanks or low -temperature storage.  \n \nGlobally, hydrogen is stored and transported through pipelines, trucks, ships, and storage tanks. Gaseous hydrogen \ncan be transported through pipelines the way natural gas is transported worldwide. Hydrogen can be transported \neither via the existing natura l gas infrastructure or by building new pipelines exclusively for hydrogen transport. \nHydrogen transport via existing pipelines is a low -cost option since setting up new pipeline for hydrogen transport  \n186 \n is capital intensive. For shorter distances, Hydrogen is transported over the road - in liquid tanker trucks or gaseous \ntube trailers.  \n \nPipelines or truck transport are normally used for shorter distances. However, where pipeline transport is not \npossible, hydrogen transport by ship is technically possible for longer distances, especially inter country transport.  \nGaseous hydrogen converted into liquid can be transported via sea. However, due to the costs of liquefaction, \nrefrigeration, and regasification, it is a high -cost operation.  \n \nLiquified or compressed hydrogen can be stored in storage tanks specially designed for hydrogen storage. Some \nof the popular hydrogen storage options include compression or cryogenic systems (or their combination), \nchemical production systems (such as ammonia), nanomaterial -based storage, and geologic storage. The tanks are \ntypically found at product ion facilities, transport terminals and end use locations.  \n \nInfrastructure requirements for hydrogen storage and transport  \n \nThe hydrogen infrastructure can be referred to hydrogen storage, transportation, storage terminals and \ninfrastructure available for export. Hydrogen storage systems are critical components in the use of hydrogen as \nenergy carrier. Compressed gas storage an d liquid hydrogen storage are commonly used storage systems. \nDevelopment of effective hydrogen storage systems is essential for various applications. Choice of storage of \nhydrogen largely depends on quantity, economy and end use. Different types of tanks s uch as gaseous hydrogen \nstorage tanks, liquid hydrogen storage tanks (cryogenic tanks), horizontal cylindrical with hemispherical ends, \nvertical cylindrical with hemispherical ends and spherical storage tanks etc. are available in market. In India, \nseveral  initiatives are under process for integration of hydrogen with natural gas through existing natural gas \npipelines. Even though this is a low -cost option, it requires careful monitoring to ensure the correct percentage of \nblending. Additionally, on arrival  at destination, additional technology is required to separate hydrogen from \nnatural gas leading to more cost. NTPC Green Energy Ltd. has commissioned India's first green hydrogen blending \nproject. The green hydrogen blending has been started in the piped natural gas (PNG) network of NTPC Kawas \ntownship, Surat. The project is a joint effort of NTPC and Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL). Adani Total Gas Ltd. \n(ATGL) has also announced the initiation of a \u2018Green Hydrogen Blending Pilot Project\u2019 for Ahmedabad in \nGujara t. Previously, GAIL (India) Ltd. had commenced its project of blending hydrogen with natural gas in \nIndore, MP. A key component of the National Green Hydrogen Mission is the identification and development of \nregions capable of supporting large scale produc tion and/or utilization of Hydrogen as Green Hydrogen Hubs. \nThe Mission provides for setting up of two Green Hydrogen hubs in the initial phase. The Ministry of Ports, \nShipping and Waterways has identified three major ports viz. Deendayal Port (Kandla), Pa radip and V.O. \nChidambaranar (Tuticorin) Ports to be developed as hydrogen hubs. Alternatively, hydrogen can be transported \nin the form of ammonia, methanol and liquid organic hydrogen. At present, around 13 port in India handle \nammonia imports in bulk vol umes.  \n \nPLI Scheme for green hydrogen production and electrolysers manufacturing  \nPLI Scheme under SIGHT Scheme  \n \nIn July 2023, SECI has issued a Tender for selection of green hydrogen producers for setting up 450,000 MT per \nannum production facilities for green hydrogen in India under the SIGHT Scheme (Mode -1-Tranche -I). The green \nhydrogen auction, which offered a pe r-kilogram maximum of 50 rupees in the first year, 40 rupees in the second, \nand 30 rupees in the third, awarded subsidies to eight companies out of thirteen bidders. Total Capacity available \nfor bidding under Technology Agnostic Pathways (Bucket I) was 410 ,000 MT/annum and Biomass Based \nPathways (Bucket II) 40,000 MT/annum.  \n \nUnder its first green hydrogen tender, India has awarded incentives to various bidders for a total production of \nmore than 400kt per annum.  \n \nThe scheme guidelines for SIGHT  Mode 2A (aggregation model for Green Ammonia)  and Mode 2B (aggregation \nmodel for Green Hydrogen)  have been notified on 16th January 2024. Further, in July 2024, MNRE has notified \nguidelines under SIGHT for green hydrogen production (under Mode -1) Tranche -II for setting up 450,000 TPA \ngreen hydrogen. The total government outlay for both the Tranches is Rs. 131 billion.  \n \nPilot Schemes for use of green hydrogen  \n \nShipping Sector: The Central Government has issued guidelines for undertaking pilot projects for using green \nhydrogen in the shipping sector. Two areas have been identified as thrust areas under the pilot projects. These are  \n187 \n retrofitting of existing ships to enable them to run on Green Hydrogen or its derivatives; and development of \nbunkering and refueling facilities in ports on international shipping lanes for fuels based on Green Hydrogen. The \nScheme will be implemented with  a total budgetary outlay of Rs. 1.15 billion till the fiscal 2026.  \n \nSteel Sector:  The Central Government has come up with guidelines for undertaking pilot projects for using green \nhydrogen in the steel sector. Three areas have been identified as thrust areas for the pilot projects in the steel \nsector. These are use of Hydrogen in Direc t Reduced Ironmaking process; use of Hydrogen in Blast Furnace; and \nsubstitution of fossil fuels with Green Hydrogen in a gradual manner. The scheme will also support pilot projects \ninvolving any other innovative use of hydrogen for reducing c arbon emissions in iron and steel production. The \nScheme will be implemented with a total budgetary outlay of Rs. 4.55 billion till fiscal 2030.  \n \nTransport sector: The Central Government has issued guidelines for undertaking pilot projects for using green \nhydrogen in the transport sector. The scheme will support development of technologies for use of Green Hydrogen \nas a fuel in Buses, Trucks, and 4 -wheelers, based on  fuel cell -based propulsion technology / internal combustion \nengine -based propulsion technology. The other thrust area for the scheme is to support development of \ninfrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations. The Scheme will be impl emented with a total budgetary outlay \nof Rs. 4.96 billion till the fiscal 2026.  \n \nElectrolysers  \n \nElectrolyser technologies vary with respect to cell design, variation within components, and degree of technology \nmaturity. Alkaline and PEM electrolysers are the most advanced technologies with higher adoption rates \ncompared to other technologies. On the other hand, Solid oxide and AEM (anion exchange membrane) \nelectrolysers have high potential but are much less mature technologies.  \n \nAs per NITI Aayog, India may witness a 20 GW electrolyser demand by 2030. There have been a number of \nannouncements by key industry players towards boosting the electrolyser production capacity in India. Adani \nNew Industries Limited (ANIL) is currently set ting up a 5 GW integrated electrolyser plant and has signed an \nagreement with Cavendish Renewable Technology (CRT) to manufacture electrolysers based on AE, PEM and \nSOEC technologies. Ohmium, which has a PEM electrolyser capacity of 500 MW/year set up in K arnataka has \nplans to take its capacity to 2 GW in the near future. Greenko and John Cockerill partnered in March 2022 to set \nup a 2 GW electrolyser manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh. H2E Power Systems is building a 1 GW \nelectrolyser plant in a phased manner while exploring all four electrolyser technologies. Lastly, Reliance has \npartnered with Stiesdal and L&T with HydrogenPro to set up AE -based electrolyser plants in Gujarat and \nMaharashtra, respectively.  \n \nIn the global scenario, China presently dominates electrolyser manufacture with players like LONGi, PERIC and \nSungrow Power. However, American and European players have announced significant capacity plans that will \nmake them competitive over the next few years.  \n \nExisting major electrolyser manufacturers globally  \nManufacturer  Country  Technology  Existing Capacity  Expansion Plans  \nLONGi  China  Alkaline  1.5 GW  5 GW by 2025  \nPERIC  China  Alkaline/PEM  1.5 GW  - \nSungrow  China  Alkaline/PEM  1.1 GW  1.1 GW by 2024  \nJohn Cockerill  Belgium  Alkaline  1.0 GW 8 GW by 2025  \nThyssenkrupp  Germany  Alkaline  1.0 GW  5 GW by 2025  \nPlug Power  US PEM  1.0 GW  10-12 GW by 2025  \nITM Power  UK PEM  1.0 GW  5 GW by 2024  \nNel US Alkaline/PEM  0.5 GW  4 GW by 2025  \nBloom Energy  US SOEC  2.0 GW  - \nSource: Company websites, CRISIL MI&A Consulting   \n188 \n  \nIncentive scheme for Electrolyser manufacturing under SIGHT  program  \n \nThe MNRE has issued guidelines for the implementation of the SIGHT programme in June 2023. This programme \nconsists of two components: the incentive scheme for electrolyser manufacturing (component -I) and the incentive \nscheme for hydrogen production (compon ent-II). The national green hydrogen mission has allocated a total of Rs. \n174.90 billion for the SIGHT programme, with Rs 44.40 billion allocated for electrolyser manufacturing and Rs. \n130.50 billion for green hydrogen production.  \nComponent -I focuses on the electrolyser scheme with an allocation of Rs. 44.40 billion, aiming to maximize \ndomestic electrolyser manufacturing capacity. The first phase of the SIGHT programme would assist in \ndeveloping 1500 MW of manufacturing capacity. Th e incentives for electrolyser manufacturing would be \nprovided based on manufacturing capacity, calculated in rupees per kilowatt, for a period of 5 years from the start \nof electrolyser manufacturing.  \n \nThe introduction of these schemes is expected to have a transformative effect on the Green Hydrogen ecosystem \nin India, propelling it forward and laying the groundwork for a cleaner and more sustainable energy future for the \ncountry.  \n \nSECI issued its first electrolyser manufacturing tender awarded under SIGHT program for total manufacturing \ncapacity of 1.5 GW.  \n \nSubsequently, in August 2024, SECI announced the snapshot of opening of enevlope -2 under SIGHT (Tranche \nII) for a total capacity of 1.5 GW.  \n \nOverview of current market size and outlook  \n \nAfter China and USA as of March 2024, India is the third largest consumer & producer of hydrogen in the world. \nIn 2020, India\u2019s hydrogen demand stood at 6 million tonnes (MT) per year. ~48% hydrogen is used in fertilizers \nto produce ammonia/urea and ~46% in refineries for hydrodesulfuriz ation. India\u2019s grey hydrogen market is \nestimated to be ~ USD 9 -10 billion considering production costs of ~USD 1.5 -1.8 per kg. Additionally, India\u2019s \nannual Ammonia consumption for fertilizer production is about 15 MTPA, roughly 15% of this demand (over 2 \nMTPA) is currently met from imports. Driven by captive consumption by refineries, fertilisers and ammonia, the \nhydrogen demand in expected to reach ~11 -12 MTPA by 2030 making it ~USD 22 -25 billion market. Out of this \n~4-4.5 MTPA is expected from refineries and ~6 -6.5 MTPA from Fertilisers. Very small quantum (~0.5 to 0.75 \nMTPA) will be from Petrochem and other industries. Considering ~8 -10% of hydrogen demand from fertilisers \nand 22 -24% of hydrogen demand from refineries can be met through green hydrogen in 2030, ~1.4 -1.8 MTPA \nwill be from green hydrogen. Considering a production cost of ~USD 2 to 2.5 per kg, the green hydrogen market \nis expected to be ~USD 3 -4 billion in 2030.   \n189 \n Landscape of leading project developers  \n \nCompetitive mapping covers the details of companies, their products and services within a given market to understand competit ive intensity. Some of the key players in the \nrenewable energy sector include NTPC Green Energy (~3.5 GW operational solar and wind ), Adani Green Energy (~11.2 GW operational wind, solar and hybrid), Renew \nPower (~8.3 GW operational wind & solar), ACME Solar (1.34 GW operational solar), TATA Power RE (~4.7 GW operational solar an d wind), Greenko (5.4 GW operational \nwind and solar) and  JSW Neo (operational ~0.7 GW Solar and 2 GW wind) as of 30th September 2024.

Further, it is lower than its  peers, indicating higher funding \nthrough equity.  \no With strong parent support and diversified portfolio with long term PPA, the Company is able to maintain a healthy interest c overage ratio.  \n\u2022 The Company is  promoted by its parent company, NTPC Limited, India\u2019s largest power company both in terms of installed capacity as of March 3 1, 2024, and power \ngeneration in Fiscal 2024. NTPC Limited is a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the ownership of the  Ministry of Power of the Government of India.  \n\u2022 The Company benefits from the support, vision, resources and experience of the NTPC Group which is looking to expand its non -fossil -based capacity to 45 -50% of its \nportfolio that will include 60 GW RE capacity by 2032.  \n\u2022 The NTPC Group is a large -scale integrated energy business with an electric power generating capacity of over 76 GW as of 30 September 2024, across coa l, hydro, gas \nand renewable operations with a pan -India presence.  \n\u2022 As of 30 September 2024, the NTPC Group contributed ~17% in India\u2019s total installed capacity and contributed ~24% in total po wer generated in India during the six \nmonths ended 30 September 2024.  \n\u2022 The company enjoys a strong parentage of NTPC which has a legacy of around five decades, is one of India\u2019s largest power comp anies, and has experience in operating \nand maintaining power stations efficiently and in acquiring land for large power projects th roughout India.  \n\u2022 The NTPC Group also brings to the fore financial strength of Rs 4,922,304 million of assets as of 30 September 2024. NTPC lim ited has highest credit rating from \nleading Indian rating agencies and ratings equivalent to India\u2019s sovereign ratings from foreign  rating agencies. NTPC\u2019s Green arm NGEL as well as its Subsidiary NREL \nalso enjoy highest credit rating from leading Indian rating agencies.  \n\u2022 NGEL is one of the top 10 leading renewable energy companies in India (in terms of total operational capacity) as of September 2024.  \n\u2022 NGEL is a subsidiary of NTPC Limited (a \u2018Maharatna\u2019 CPSE) and the largest central public sector renewable energy player (excl uding hydro) in terms of operating \ncapacity as of September 30, 2024, and power generation in Fiscal 2024.   \n193 \n \u2022 In Fiscal 2024, NGEL has emerged as the market leader in the winning capacities under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding in the  sector with an aggregate capacity of 3.5 \nGW which is equivalent to AC capacity of around 5 GW.  \n\u2022 NGEL has been one of the front runners in development of Round the Clock RE Projects in the country. It is presently developi ng 2.7 GW of RE RTC capacities which \nalso includes one of the world\u2019s largest RE RTC Projects of 1.3 GW  \n\u2022 The assets owned by the Company are diversified into solar and wind with presence in multiple locations in more than six stat es which helps mitigate the risk of location -\nspecific generation variability.  \n\u2022 The Company has superior execution capabilities which is demonstrated almost 50 years of successful operations by its parent company. The Company also benefits from \nlong-term experience in dealing with State DISCOMs by its parent company.     \n \n \n194 \n \n Key challenges/threats impacting RE Sector  \n \nKey challenges and threats impacting renewable energy sector  \n \nThreats  \n \nAny adverse shift in government policies, including reductions in incentives or changes in energy regulations, can \nsignificantly impact NTPC  GEL\u2019s revenue and profitability. However, considering the COP commitment, climate \nchange ambitions and government push for RE, the chances of drastic changes in regulatory regime are less likely. \nThis can also be ascertained from the fact that as against c apacity addition of ~70 GW of RE, only ~20 GW of \nconventional capacity is added over the last 5 years. There were s ome delays in signing PSAs having higher tariffs \nby Discoms due to declining tariffs in subsequent tenders. However, with the government\u2019s plan for stricter \nadherence to RPOs, higher penalty in case of non -compliance, and revision of tariff in manufacturin g-linked \ntenders, PSA signing activity improved during fiscal 2022 onwards. There are only a few states which are \ncomplying with the RPO obligations fully and there has been limited enforcement on obligated entities - discoms \nand open access and captive po wer users - to meet RPO targets. Proposed amendment to Electricity Act, 2003 has \nstipulated a penalty on RPO non -compliance and uniform imposition of penalties and strict enforcement would \nbe critical for significant improvement and fair distribution of RP O compliance across states. The RE sector is \nhighly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Established competitors along with capable \nnew entrants can pose challenges. Climate change and extreme weather events can affect the performance  and \nreliability of renewable energy systems, potentially leading to disruptions or damage to infrastructure.  \n \nChallenges  \n \nThere is counterparty credit risk due to the depleted financial position of most Discoms. Due to legacy issues, \nhigher T&D losses, lack of adequate tariff revisions, lack of timely subsidy support, operational challenges, \nfinancial position in most of the State Discoms is weak. However, with competitive tariffs, payment security \nmechanism, diversification in counter parties largely mitigates the counterparty credit risk. Further, execution risk \nin under construction projects may impact profitability and in turn liquidity. However, experience in execution of \nlarge -scale projects should mitigate this risk. Furthermore, availability of contiguous land and acquisition \nchallenges associated with land parcels are some of the key challenges that developers are faci ng. To acquire large \ntracts of land in a single resourceful location, many stakeholders have to be involved, which slows down the pace \nof project execution. The 40 GW solar park scheme, which provides land to successful bidders for setting up of \nthe projec ts, is facilitative in this aspect. Availability of timely transmission connectivity is another challenge. To \noptimize costs, utilization levels, and losses associated with the transmission system, it is crucial to have robust \ntransmission planning. Concer ns about connectivity for renewable projects have been raised by the various \nstakeholders at the appropriate levels. Nodal agencies (PGCIL and SECI) have planned various schemes to reduce \ngrid congestion and enhance connectivity, taking this into account. Green Energy Corridor Scheme and \nRenewable Energy Zones expected to add ~80 GW of transmission grid capacity, taking it to more than 100 GW \nfor RE projects. This will give comfort against the planned capacity additions in renewable energy segment. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n     \n \n \n195 \n \n OUR BUSINES S \nSome of the information in this section, including information with respect to our business plans and strategies, \ncontain forward -looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

We are the \nlargest renewable energy public sector enterprise (excluding hydro) in terms of operating capacity as of September \n30, 2024 and power generation in Fiscal 2024. (Source: CRISIL Report, November  2024 ). Our renewable energy \nportfolio encompasses both solar and wind power assets with presence across multiple locations in more than six \nstates which helps mitigate the risk of location -specific generation variability. (Source: CRISIL Report, November \n2024 ). Our operational capacity was 3, 220 MW of solar projects and 100 MW of wind projects across six (6) \nstates as of September  30, 2024.  We are strategically focused on developing a portfolio of utility -scale renewable \nenergy projects, as well as projects for public sector undertakings (\u201c PSUs \u201d) and Indian corporates. Our projects \ngenerate renewable power and feed that power into the grid, supplying a utility or offtaker with energy. For our \noperational projects, we have entered into long -term Power Purchase Agreements (\u201c PPAs \u201d) or Letters of Award \n(\u201cLoAs \u201d) with an offtaker that is either a Central government agency like the Solar Energy Corp oration of India \n(\u201cSECI \u201d) or a State government agency or public utility.  \n \nAs of September 30 , 2024, our \u201cPortfolio\u201d consisted of 16,896  MWs including 3,320 MWs of operating projects \nand 13,576 MWs of contracted and awarded projects.  As of September 30 , 2024, our \u201c Capacity under Pipeline , \nfor which a memorandum of understanding (\u201c MOU \u201d) or term sheet has been entered with joint venture partners \nor offtakers but where definitive agreements have not yet been entered, consisted of 9,175 MWs. As of September \n30, 2024, our Capacity under Pipeline together with our Portfolio consisted o f 26,071 MWs.  \n \nWe measure the rated capacity of our plants in megawatts in alternate current (AC).

Our in -house team, working with third -party aggregators, developers, and EPC \ncontractors, manages the land acquisition process. Our power projects are located primarily on land leased from \nstate governments and third parties and freehold land purchased by us from private individuals and entities. As of \nSeptember 30 , 2024, we owned approximately 8,900  acres of freehold land and approximately 45,700  acres of \nleasehold land relating to our projects.  For more information, see \u201c- Properties \u201d on pag e 234. \n \nThe availability of transmission infrastructure for interconnection to common grid is critical for project\u2019s viability. \nWe evaluate the power evacuation capacity available at nearby inter -state/intra state substations using our in -\nhouse expertise and publi cly available documents. Our project commissioning timelines are generally aligned \nwith respect to the substations\u2019 readiness for evacuation of power. The overall process involves submitting various \napplications to relevant statutory bodies and independent  system operators for securing grid connection approvals, \ninstallation of transmission lines including arrangement of a right of way. We benefit from the long -term \nexperience of the NTPC Group in connecting its projects to the grid.  \n \nFor solar energy projects, construction includes design, engineering, procurement, structure, module and inverter \ninstallations, substation construction, interconnection work, and the balance of plant construction. In solar \nprojects, we have diversified ou r strategy for setting up power plants from using turnkey engineering, \nprocurement, and construction (\u201c EPC \u201d) contract model (where the contractor is responsible from concept through \ncommissioning) to a model where we take responsibility for procurement of major equipment and supplies and \nthe contractor builds, commissions and hands over the solar plant. We also use the turnkey EPC contract model \nbased on specific project conditions.  \n    \n \n \n207 \n \n For wind energy projects construction includes turbine installations and the balance of plant, which encompasses \ntransmission lines and substation. In wind projects, we generally use the turnkey EPC model, entering into \ncontracts with OEMs for manufacturin g, installing, and commissioning wind turbines and the balance of plant. \nHowever, we have also started bifurcating the total project scope into balance of plant (including procurement of \nland) and supply and installation of wind turbine generators.  \n \nSet forth below is a diagram setting forth our models for power plant development.  \n \n \n \nWe purchase major components such as solar panels, inverters, wind turbines and some components of power \nevacuation systems directly from domestic and international manufacturers. We have an established network of \nreputed vendors located in India and overs eas. We have a rigorous quality assurance and vendor empanelment \nprocess, with a limited number of approved suppliers.  Further, we aim to continue to leverage the NTPC Group\u2019s \neconomies of scale to negotiate and reduce the cost of components, equipment and mat erials for our solar and \nwind projects from domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers and suppliers.  \n \nWe have a rigorous quality assurance and vendor empanelment process, with a limited number of approved \nsuppliers. Our inhouse procurement team selects suppliers based on expected cost, reliability, commercial \nconditions, manufacturing capacity, track record, quality, warranty coverage, ease of installation and other \nancillary costs, and we have key relationships with a number of solar and wind component suppliers in the market. \nOur in -house procurement team then monitors our purchases throughout the supply chain.  \n \nOur O&M services for our renewable energy projects are provided through third -party service providers. We have \na strong focus on improving the operational efficiency of our plants. Towards that end, we are employing \ntechnologies including  \n \n\u2022 Robotic dry cleaning of photovoltaic arrays;  \n\u2022 Drone photovoltaic  thermography;  \n\u2022 SCB thermography;  \n\u2022 Live dashboards for generation performance monitoring on our plant information server;  \n\u2022 Mechanized module washing, vegetation removal;  \n\u2022 CCTV Surveillance for plant security; and  \n   \n \n \n208 \n \n \u2022 Module and string level I -V tracing.  \n \nUsing these O&M technologies and by adopting industry -leading O&M practices, we will be able to maximize \nand maintain the efficiency and life cycles of our equipment.

For more information, see \u201c Our Projects \u2013 \nPipeline a nd Joint Venture \u201d on page 219.  In addition, we are considered a partner of choice by PSUs for \nfulfillment their renewable energy development goals.  Accordingly, we will look at growth opportunities with \nPSUs as well as private corporates.  We believe that our ability to deliver comp rehensive renewable energy \nsolutions to PSU and corporate customers will enable us to capture a greater share of this fast -growing market.  \n \nFurther, on strategic basis, we will continue to evaluate accretive acquisition opportunities based on our targeted \nreturns, available synergies and offtaker criteria.  \n \nFocus on projects in new energy solutions like green hydrogen, green chemicals and storage  \n \nWe are investing in hydrogen, green chemical and battery storage capabilities and solutions as well as associated \ntechnologies. Our current initiatives in green hydrogen and green chemicals include the development of a g reen \nhydrogen hub at Pudimadaka and finalizing a tie -up for electrolysers. In the area of battery storage, we intend to \ninstall the Grid scale battery storage as part of F irm and Dispatchable Renewable Energy (FDRE)/ Round -the-\nClock  (RTC)  projects to complement the solar and wind power in addition to participate in standalone Grid scale \nbattery energy storage system service tenders in the market for various DISCOMS or Grid balancing. Further, we \nare in process to insta ll Battery Energy Storage at a NTPC Thermal plant to smooth the flexibilization on pilot \nbasis.  \n \nAccording to CRISIL Research, Battery Energy Storage  Systems (BESS) is another form of storage technology \nwhich has gained traction in the last few years. It has a very high energy density, making it appropriate to offer \nancillary services. More importantl y, BESS can be installed easily, requires less time for setup, and can be used \nfor a wide range of grid support activities, such as energy time shift, distribution deferral, and energy \narbitrage. (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024) . In that regard, a rec ent report by the CEA suggests that India \nwill require at least 41.7 GW/208 GWh of battery energy storage systems and 18.9 GW of pumped storage of \nhydroelectricity by Fiscal 2030.  \n \nWe are undertaking various initiatives that fall under Article 6.2 of Paris Agreement including investing in green \nhydrogen, green chemicals and battery storage capabilities and solutions as well as associated technologies.  \n \nOur current initiatives include:  \n \n\u2022 Developing battery storage and round -the-clock renewable energy projects;  \n\u2022 Developing green hydrogen hub at Pudimadaka;  \n\u2022 Finalising a tie -up for electrolysers;  \n\u2022 Other projects including a renewable energy park in Maharashtra and green hydrogen production in \nRajasthan.     \n \n \n211 \n \n Battery Storage and Round the clock RE Power  \n \nIn June 2023, the MOP issued guidelines for procurement of firm and dispatchable power from grid connected \nrenewable energy projects with energy storage systems. The guidelines will include configurations like Round the \nClock renewable energy with firm del ivery of power at rated capacity at any hour of the day as per the demand or \nload. (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024) .  \n \nWe have been one of the front runners in development of Round the Clock renewable energy projects in the \ncountry. (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024) .  \u201cRound the Clock \u201d renewable energy (RTC -RE) project is a \nform of supply that combines storage system such as battery energy storage system or PSP with Solar, Wind or \nHydro to meet a demand at a desired availability and cost. (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024) .We are \npresently developing 2 .7 GW of Round the Clock renewable energy capacity, which also i ncludes one of the \nworld\u2019s largest Round the Clock renewable energy projects of 1.3 GW. (Source: CRISIL Report, November 2024) .   \n \nGreen hydrogen hub  \n \nWe are developing a Green Hydrogen Hub at Pudimadaka in Andhra Pradesh. The project is spread over 1,200 \nacres for the production of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives and the manufacturing of renewable energy -related \ncomponents and systems. The land lease agreement has been signed in the month of February 2024 and the land \nis currently in possession. We have already submitted the Pre -Feasibi lity report to the Government of Andhra \nPradesh.  \n \nThe land in the industrial hub would be allocated to manufacturers of electrolysers, fuel cells, solar photovoltaic \nmodules, battery energy storage systems and other green energy systems.  The facility would be plug and play for \nthe manufactures with power, water, effluent treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, roads, landscapes, \nlogistics zone, common infrastructure, medical, shopping, convention centre, guest house and other state of art \nfacilities. An area of 300 acres is earmarked for the industrial hub and 200 acres are segregated for common infra \nand green belt. We are in discussions with various master planning and infrastructure design companies for \ncommending work on the industrial hub in Fiscal 2025.  \n600 acres of the hub will be dedicated towards green chemicals production. It includes the construction of India's \nlargest green hydrogen production facility (1,100 TPD), which would be converted to hydrogen derivatives such \nas green ammonia, green methano l, and sustainable aviation fuel, primarily focusing on the domestic, EU and \nSouth Asian export markets.  \n \nWe believe that the proposed hub has the potential to bring significant investment, employment opportunities and \neconomic benefits to Andhra Pradesh.  \n \nGreen hydrogen is not commercially viable as on the date of this Prospectus ; and there  can make no assurance \nthat green hydrogen will be commercially viable in future.  \n \nTie-up for electrolysers  \n \nThrough a competitive bidding process, we have selected two technology providers to work with us for \nparticipating in upcoming tenders on green hydrogen production.  This will allow us to participate in future \ncommercial scale green hydrogen projects.  \n \nOther JV Agreements  \n \nFurther, we have signed a JV Agreement with a state entity, Mahatma Phule Renewable Energy & Infrastructure \nTechnology Limited (MAHAPREIT)  to implement Renewable Energy Park projects, including solar, wind, and \nhybrid energy, with a capacity of up to 10 GW in Maharashtra.  \n \nAdditionally, we have signed a JV Agreement with Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited for the  \ndevelopment of renewable energy projects (solar, wind, and hybrid), with or without storage up to a total capacity \nof 25 GW. This JV Agreement also includes the production of green hydrogen and its derivatives, such as green \nammonia and green methanol, wit h a capacity of up to 1 million MT through a suitable mode .  \n    \n \n \n212 \n \n Drive efficiency and cost reductions in project execution and operating & maintenance  \n \nWe seek to further enhance our project execution efforts in order to control our costs and optimize the output of \nour projects. At the project execution stage, we intend to continue to leverage NTPC Group\u2019s economies of scale \nto negotiate and reduce the co st of both our EPC and construction contracts as well as our cost of components, \nequipment and materials for our solar and wind projects from domestic and foreign OEMs and suppliers. In project \nconstruction, we plan to take responsibility for procurement o f major equipment and supplies including modules \nand wind turbine generators. We also plan to leverage the NTPC Group\u2019s expertise in land acquisition. In addition, \nwe aim to reduce our operating and maintenance costs.  \n \nTo reduce our project costs per megawatt operating we intend to implement new technologies viz our new \nturbines, solar modules, which are capable of higher generation levels. We are incorporating robotic cleaning \nstorage technologies to reduce auxiliary po wer consumption, using artificial intelligence (\u201c AI\u201d) enabled tools for \nforecasting and scheduling, utilizing drones and new maintenance technologies as part of enhanced project \nmonitoring and O&M efforts. In addition, to further reduce our O&M costs, we are looking to  \n \n\u2022 Maintain a supply of critical spares like inverters, IDTs and Tie transformers on pooled basis which can \nbe utilized in all our nearby power plants;  \n\u2022 Award bulk O&M contracts for O&M of multiple power plant locations to optimize our annual costs;  \n\u2022 Implement manpower planning following a cluster -based approach for employee cost optimisation;  \n\u2022 Secure long term warranty coverage with OEMs for inverters and SCADA systems; and  \n\u2022 Deploy cloud computing based remote asset monitoring integrated using AI and machine learning \ntechnologies for O&M and generation performance analysis.  \n \nContinue to contribute to India\u2019s sustainability efforts  \n \nWe were established to be the renewable energy arm for the NTPC Group and to help achieve its medium -term \ntarget of achieving 60 GW of renewable capacity by 2032.

The long -term PPAs for our projects enhance the offtake security and long -term \nvisibility of our revenues. As of September 30 , 2024, our PPAs have an average term of 25 years.   For a summary \nof our PPAs, see \u201c -Our Projects \u2013 Operational Projects \u201d and \u201c -Our Projects \u2013 Contracted and Awarded Projects \u201d \non pages 216 and 217, respectively.  \n \nOur PPAs include, among other things, restrictions on contracted capacity and changes in management and \nownership of our project subsidiary undertaking the relevant project (including changes in the specified minimum \nequity shareholding of the relevant hol ding company or selected bidder in such project subsidiary).  \n \nEvents of default under our PPAs typically include failure or delay in commissioning, failure to supply power \npost the commercial operation date, failure to supply the minimum contracted power as defined in the relevant \nPPA, inability to meet our performan ce guarantees, assignment or transfer of assets or rights under the PPAs in \ncontravention of the terms thereof, liquidation, our project subsidiary\u2019s insolvency or similar events, and failure \nto operate and maintain our projects in accordance with the term s of the PPAs. Upon the occurrence of an event \nof default, we may face adverse consequences such as specific performance of the PPAs, termination of the PPAs, \npayment of liquidated damages, imposition of penalties, and exercise of step -in rights by our len ders or rights to \nreplace the relevant holding company/selected bidder or our project subsidiary as operator of the project. Most of \nour PPAs also provide for relief to the party affected in the event of a change in law or a force majeure.  \n \nTariff  \n \nTariff rates for our PPAs for solar and wind projects are determined through bidding regime, feed -in tariffs \nmechanism, or are bilaterally agreed with third -party offtakers. The majority of our PPAs provide for fixed tariff \nrates. Under a few PPAs, the tar iff is subject to escalation provisions.  \n \nProject Development  \n \nWe directly or indirectly through our Subsidiaries participate in central and state -level renewable energy auctions \nto build our Portfolio. Our significant experience with procurement, managing EPC contactors and our O&M \nexperience provides us with an adva ntage to understand cost and other operational considerations to make \ncompetitive bids, while maintaining profitable economics for a project.  \n \nThe typical development timeline for our solar and wind projects is approximately 12 to 18 months and 18 to 24 \nmonths, respectively. There are several key activities that occur sequentially or concurrently before and \nthroughout a project development cycle.  These include:  \n \n\u2022 Pre-bidding activities;  \n\u2022 Tenders and bidding;  \n\u2022 Review of data and resource assessment;  \n\u2022 Land procurement;  \n\u2022 Approvals;  \n\u2022 Financing;  \n\u2022 Transmission and interconnection;  \n\u2022 Procurement; and  \n\u2022 Construction and commissioning.  \n \nPre-Bidding Activities  \n \nOur pre -bidding activities are the earliest activity in our development process and involve a broad, high -level \nreview of potential land parcels for the power project development. Among other considerations, we constantly    \n \n \n224 \n \n evaluate the credit ratings of the state distribution utilities and central procurers, the ease of doing business in that \nlocation, relevant policies, land availability and costs, the level of solar radiation and/or wind resources (as the \ncase may be) at t he project location, payment cycles, and grid status.  \n \nTenders and Bidding  \n \nThe capacity allocation process conducted by government agencies typically involves two stages:  \n1. Shortlisting Eligible Bidders : In the first stage, eligible and prospective bidders are shortlisted based on \ntheir technical and financial capabilities. The bid documents, which include a draft of the Power Purchase \nAgreement (PPA) and other project information, are provided to each bidder upon payment of a \nprocessing fee. Additionally, bidders are usually required to deposit a bid security a mount via a bank \nguarantee, payment on order instrument or insurance surety bond.  \n \n2. Live Online Reverse Auction : In the second stage, the shortlisted bidders participate in a live online \nreverse auction to submit their tariff bids. A bucket filing method is used for selection of bidders. The \nbidders within the range as specified in the RFS documents, usually L1 tariff +2%, are selected, subject \nto the condition that cumulative capacity shortlisted is equal to the capacity eligible for award as per t he \nRFS.  \n \nThe objective of the first stage is to identify credible bidders capable of undertaking the project. The information \nsought from bidders in this stage generally pertains to their technical and financial capacities relevant to the \nproject. For bidding conso rtia, the financial eligibility criteria are typically met by the lead member or the parent \ncompany of the lead member, while the technical eligibility criteria are met by the consortium members. Only the \napplicants shortlisted in the first stage are invit ed to participate in the second stage of the bidding process. The \nnumber and nature of shortlisted bidders are based on initial bid tariffs and the quantity of bidders.  \n \nBidders are typically required to conduct their own surveys, investigations, and detailed examinations of the \nproject before submitting their bids. This includes assessing site conditions, evacuation feasibility, location, \nsurroundings, climate, availabili ty of power, water, and other utilities for construction, site access, handling and \nstorage of materials, and weather data.  \n \nWe have an organized process to effectively track policies and bid updates in the market. Upon identifying an \nopportunity, we analyze the relevant information in the request for proposal document. Our teams prepare market \nanalysis reports and financial mod els, which include key financial assumptions, to evaluate the potential \nopportunity. This information is discussed internally with our finance and technical teams and is approved by our \nmanagement committees and CEO before deciding to participate in a tend er and submit our bids. We maintain a \nproject development information database that helps us collate market data and propose competitive bids for \nprojects.  \n \nOnce a bid is won, a letter of intent is issued, and a PPA is signed. This agreement sets forth the commercial \noperation date before which the plant should be commissioned and outlines the terms for power off -take, including \ntariffs.  \n \nReview of Data and Resource Assessment  \n \nWe perform wind and solar resource assessments at proposed project sites to estimate annual energy production \nusing various tools and resources, both in -house and third -party. Initially, we evaluate potential sites by reviewing \npublicly available solar map s. Our in -house teams use wind and solar flow modeling tools to estimate potential \nwind speeds, irradiation levels, and other energy indicators. We use WindPro software for wind energy assessment \nand use tools like solar GIS, Meteonorm and PVSyst for solar  evaluations.  \n \nGenerally, solar resources are significantly more uniform and predictable than wind resources. The databases and \nsoftware available for solar assessments are substantially comprehensive, providing a higher degree of accuracy \ncompared to those for wind reso urces. We find these databases and software to be adequate for all our solar \nresource assessment needs.  \n    \n \n \n225 \n \n Land Procurement  \n \nOur in -house team, working with third -party aggregators, developers, and EPC contractors, manages the land \nacquisition process for solar and wind projects. Once a project site is identified and assessments are complete, we \nbegin the procurement process. Our projects are setup on both government and private land. In cases where land \nis allotted by the government, we work closely with government agencies to avoid delays.  \n \nWe enter into conveyance deeds with landowners to secure the title needed to build on the site, including \nmeteorological masts, roads, electric lines, substations, turbines, solar plants, and associated facilities. For \ngovernment revenue land or forest lan d under Indian law, we enter into long -term leases. Ownership of project \nsites allows us to optimize wind energy projects to maximize power generation. We also obtain necessary \napprovals, such as conversion certificates, forest clearances, and environmenta l approvals. In some cases, like \nsolar parks, the developer is solely responsible for land acquisition and approvals.  \n \nApprovals  \n \nAfter identifying and acquiring or leasing the land needed for our projects, we begin the approvals process with \nrelevant local and state agencies. This process continues through various stages of project development and \nincludes identifying required permi ts, holding preliminary meetings with state and central agencies, conducting \nproject studies, responding to information requests, and seeking project approvals from state or central \ngovernment bodies.  \n \nFinancing   \n \nWe secure financing for our projects during both the development and operational phases. Initially, we fund \nprojects using our own capital resources.  \n \nWe obtain borrowings for our projects from multiple sources, including commercial banks (both state -owned and \nprivate sector banks in India) and non -banking financial companies. Our borrowings include both project -specific \nfinancing arrangements collateral ized by the underlying power plants and balance sheet financing.  \n \nTransmission and Interconnection  \n \nThe availability of transmission infrastructure for interconnection to common grid is critical for a project\u2019s \nviability. We evaluate the power evacuation capacity available at nearby inter -state/intra state grid substations \nusing our in -house expertise an d publicly available documents. The project commissioning timelines are generally \naligned with respect to the substation readiness for evacuation of power. The overall process involves submitting \nvarious applications to relevant statutory bodies and indepe ndent system operators for securing grid connection \napprovals, installation of transmission lines including arrangement of right of way etc. Power from our wind and \nsolar energy projects are typically evacuated to the common grid through high voltage (66/1 10/132/220/400 kV) \ntransmission lines from dedicated pooling stations at project end, ensuring stable energy transmission and \nminimizing grid instability and losses. We adhere to standard CEA (Central Electricity Authority) specifications \nand equipment rat ings for transmission elements for asset optimization and ensuring long -term trouble -free \noperation.  \n \nEquipment Procurement  \n \nWe have a rigorous quality assurance and vendor empanelment process, and our in -house procurement team \nselects suppliers. For further details, see \u201c- Suppliers \u201d on page 228. \n \nConstruction and Commissioning  \n \nFor solar energy projects, construction includes design, engineering, procurement, structure, module and inverter \ninstallations, substation construction, interconnection work, and the balance of plant construction. In solar \nprojects, we have diversified ou r strategy for setting up power plants from using turnkey EPC contract model to    \n \n \n226 \n \n a model where we take responsibility for procurement of major equipment and supplies and the contractor builds, \ncommissions and hands over the solar plant. We still use the turnkey EPC contract model based on specific project \nconditions.  \n \nFor wind energy projects construction includes turbine installations and the balance of plant, which encompasses \ntransmission lines and the substation. In wind projects, we generally use the turnkey EPC model, entering into \ncontracts with OEMs for manufact uring, installing, and commissioning wind turbines and the balance of plant. \nHowever, we have also started bifurcating the total project scope into balance of plant (including procurement of \nland) and supply and installation of wind turbine generators.  \n \nConstruction (including land acquisition) typically takes approximately 18 to 24 months for wind energy projects \nand 12 to 18 months for solar energy projects. Our projects team supervises and oversees all aspects of \nconstruction. For solar energy projects , commissioning involves testing DC installation, inverters and power \ntransformers and integrating them within the project and the transmission system. For wind energy projects, \ncommissioning involves testing each turbine and integrating it within the proj ect and the transmission system.  \n \nOnce our wind or solar energy projects begin transmitting electricity to the relevant grid, we secure commissioning \ncertificates from state and central government authorities as per procedure.  \n \nOperations  and Maintenance  \nAs of September 30 , 2024, we had 3,320  MWs operating across 17 solar projects and 2 wind projects.  We focus \non improving the operational efficiency of our plants. We regularly measure the performance of our plants by \nusing the industry measure of estimates of generation/capacity utilization factor (CUF).  We deploy cluster \napproach for O&M of plant: centralised monitoring group, cluster level monitoring at regional level and plant \nlevel mon itoring and supervision. We analyse performance by capturing live data using PI server and inhouse \ndeveloped dashboards. The maintenance activities are controlled through monitoring timely deployment of daily, \nmonthly, quarterly and annual maintenance plan s and guidelines and checklist implementation.  \nWe focus on improving the operational efficiency of our plants. We also are employing O&M technology as set \nforth below.  \n \n\u2022 Robotic dry cleaning of photovoltaic arrays  \nRobotic dry -cleaning robots are mounted on rails of PV array and self -propelled and can move across \nthe PV arrays. They are programmed to clean the surface of the panels using brushes, air blowers, or \nmicrofiber pads, effectively removing dust and dirt.  \n \n\u2022 Drone photovoltaic  thermography  \nThis technique involves the use of drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras to capture thermal \nimages of PV modules during peak generating hours. By analysing these thermal images, we can detect \nanomalies such as hotspots, micro -cracks, shading, bypass  diode faults, string outages and other \ndegradations that can reduce the efficiency and lifespan of solar panels.  \n \n\u2022 SCB thermography  \nSCB (String Combiner Box) thermography is a diagnostic technique which uses thermal imaging \ncameras to detect abnormal temperature variations that can indicate potential issues such as loose \nconnections, overloaded circuits, blown fuses, or faulty strings.  Early detection of these issues through \nthermography helps prevent SCB failure, reduces downtime, and maintains optimal plant performance.  \n \n\u2022 Live dashboards for generation performance monitoring on PI server  \nOnline dashboards are built on the PI (Plant Information) server platform, a data management and \nvisualization system developed by OSIsoft. PI Server continuously collects data from the power plant\u2019s \nLocal SCADA servers through internet which includes data  from various sensors and devices, such as \ncurrent, voltages, power and energy output, wind speeds, solar irradiance and other weather parameters, \ntemperatures etc. Using these dashboards, we are able to detect performance issues and outages and    \n \n \n227 \n \n take timely actions necessary.  \n \n\u2022 Mechanized module washing, vegetation removal  \nSpecialized vehicles with water storage and pumping system with extendable arms equipped with water \nsprayers are used to clean solar PV arrays in large solar farms. The vehicles navigate between solar \npanel rows, allowing rapid and effective cleaning of va st areas. Clean solar panels capture more \nsunlight, significantly boosting energy generation. Regular mechanized washing can improve \nefficiency of solar panels, especially in dusty environments.  \n \nMechanized mowers and trimmers are also used to cut grass and weeds around solar panels and other \nsurrounding areas on a regular basis. These machines are designed to operate close to the PV modules \nwithout causing damage. By regularly trimming vegetation,  solar panels receive unobstructed sunlight, \nmaximizing energy output and reducing performance losses due to shading.  \n \n\u2022 CCTV Surveillance for plant security  \nSolar power plants contain valuable assets such as solar panels, inverters, transformers, and cabling etc, \nwhich can be targeted for theft or vandalism. CCTV systems help deter such activities by providing real -\ntime monitoring and recorded evidence of any unauthorized actions. CCTV cameras are strategically \nplaced around the plant\u2019s perimeter and monitor entry and exit gates, detect intrusions, and provide early \nwarning of potential security breaches.  \n\u2022 Module and string level I -V tracing  \nModule and string level I -V (current -voltage) tracing is a diagnostic technique used in solar power plants \nto assess the performance and health of PV modules and strings. The I -V curve represents the relationship \nbetween the current (I) and voltage (V) of a solar PV module or string under specific operating \nconditions. By measuring and analysing these curves, we are able to gain insights into the performance \ncharacteristics of the solar panels and PV strings and identify degradation and defects like cracked  cells, \nfaulty junction boxes, module mismatches, wiring faults etc.  \nModule and String level I -V tracing helps identify problems at an early stage, allowing for timely repairs \nor replacements ensuring that the entire system operates efficiently.  \nWe believe that by the use of these O&M technologies and by adopting industry -leading O&M practices, we will \nbe able to maximize and maintain the efficiency and life cycles of our equipment.  \n \nSolar Operations and Maintenance  \nOur solar energy projects receive O&M services through third -party providers supported by our O&M team. The \nO&M services, includes activities such as:  \n\u2022 Continuous plant operation and preventive maintenance;  \n\u2022 Round -the-clock security;  \n\u2022 Maintenance of switchyards and transmission lines;  \n\u2022 Supply of spares and consumables;  \n\u2022 Plant monitoring and logging;  \n\u2022 Insurance and warranty claims;  \n\u2022 Module cleaning and vegetation control;  \n\u2022 Seasonal tilt adjustments for photovoltaic modules;  \n\u2022 Photovoltaic module thermography;  \n\u2022 IV testing and electroluminescence mass testing on a case -by-case basis;  \n\u2022 Plant availability warranty; and  \n\u2022 Forecasting and scheduling.  \n \nThese third -party contracts/EPC usually have fixed annual charges. Performance targets are set and evaluated as    \n \n \n228 \n \n per contract terms and conditions. If these targets are not met, the service provider is liable to pay compensation \nas outlined in the contract. Contracts can be terminated by either party upon events such as bankruptcy, insolvency, \nfailure to discharge ob ligations, unauthorized contract assignment, or material breach of terms.  \nThe average life expectancy of a solar energy project is up to 25 years.  \n \n \n \nWind Operations and Maintenance  \n \nO&M services for our wind energy projects are provided both in -house and through third -party providers.  \n \nFor utility -scale wind energy projects, we enter into contracts with O&M contractors, typically spanning five to \n10 years or with O&M contractors with expert support from EPC/ OEM.  \n \nServices include:  \n \n \u2022 Coordination with state electricity boards and government authorities;  \n \u2022 Management and maintenance of equipment and evacuation infrastructure; and  \n \u2022 Technical services, including reporting, testing, and inspection.  \n \nContracts can be terminated by either party upon events such as bankruptcy, insolvency, failure to discharge \nobligations, unauthorized assignment by the O&M provider, or material breach of terms. Performance is subject \nto changes in applicable laws.  \n \nWhile turbine manufacturers provide on -site O&M of turbines and the balance of the plant, including pooling sub - \nstations, we ensure regulatory compliance and maintain insurance.  \n \nThe average life expectancy of wind energy projects is approximately 25 years.  \nSuppliers  \n \nOperating equipment for solar energy projects primarily consists of solar panels, inverters, cables, solar mounting \nstructures, trackers, transmission lines and power evacuation systems.

In addition to being audited regularly by internal a nd third -party auditors, we engage with third parties \nto prepare environmental and social impact assessments for all of the projects that are under development.  \n \nHealth and employee safety  \n \nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of workplace health and safety, we aim to become a zero -accident \norganisation. Any mishaps or accidents at our facilities could lead to personal injury, property damage, production \nloss, adverse publicity and legal claims. We believe that accidents and occupational health hazards can be \nsignificantly reduced through a systematic analysis and control of risks and by providing appropriate training to \nour management and our employees.  \n \nWe have a safety management system which has been implemented across our projects.  Further, we conduct \ncomprehensive safety reviews and audits by safety consultants. As of September 30 , 2024, we had a health, safety \nand environment team with the responsibility of round -the-clock monitoring of our operations.    \n \nEnvironment  \n \nAs a pure play renewable energy company, we are working towards clean energy transition and contributing to \nIndia to meet its Net zero target.  \n \nOur environment and sustainability efforts include:  \n \n\u2022 We estimate that our renewable power generation helped to avoid the production of approximately 5.355 \nmillion tons of CO 2e in Fiscal 2024.  \n\u2022 We are working to reduce our water consumption and recognize that the water required for cleaning our \nsolar modules may result in adverse environmental impact. We are installing robotic dry -cleaning \nsystems at all our project sites to eliminate the requirement for water.  \n\u2022 We have registered our renewable energy projects with different international carbon programs, such as \nClean Development Mechanism (CDM), Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and Global Carbon council \n(GCC).  \n\u2022 We a have a dedicated Carbon Management Group with a specific vision to position us as a leading \norganization in carbon management to synergise all business activities with sustainable development, \nparticularly to address issues related to climate change r isks and opportunities arising from carbon \nmitigation initiatives. The management has been active in engaging with national and international \nclimate change stakeholders to ensure that the organization have deeper insights of fast evolving \ndomestic and int ernational carbon markets.   \n \nInformation Technology (IT)  \n \nRenewable energy projects face the challenge of disparate locations spread over entire India. Digitalization of \nbusiness processes is a fundamental strategy for our agile decision making. The key responsibility of our IT team \nincludes providing secure, aut henticated, authorised, and point to point data transmission and access to our \nbusiness and enterprise applications through high bandwidth MPLS links.  \nWe utilize an enterprise resource planning solution to assists us with various business functions including finance \nand controlling, material management, plant operations and maintenance, industry specific utility, and human \nresource functions.     \n \n \n232 \n \n All our engineering and business processes are digitized to ensure uninterrupted anytime and anywhere secure \naccess from planning, concept to commissioning enterprise operations.  \n \n \nInformation security and disaster recovery  \nInformation security is one of the key focus areas. All our enterprise, business process, and production data are \nsecured and in compliance to cyber secured guidelines from applicable statutory bodies. All the endpoints are \nsecured through Gateway security  equipment and updated in real time for latest signatures.  \nAll our systems are disaster recovery ready with data centres located at Noida and Hyderabad. Our data centres \nare designed on Tier III principles and help us to ensure and provide seamless, uninterrupted, zero data loss \nbusiness operations.  \nFor information on the risk to our IT systems, see \u201c Risk Factors - Failure or disruption of our IT systems may \nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition \u201d on page 81. \n \nInsurance  \n \nWe maintain insurance coverage that we consider necessary for our business. We have a standard fire and allied \nperils insurance policy for all our operating stations and all risk erection insurance policy through the contractors \nfor our projects. Insurance against theft, robbery, workmen compensation and general liability insuranc e are being \ntaken by our O&M contractors in the operating stations. We have not taken insurance to protect against all risk \nand liabilities. For example, we do not have loss of bus iness income policy  \n \nThe Company was incorporated on April 7, 2022. Insurance coverage as at March 31, 2023 was obtained by \nNTPC Limited for its assets including us.  \n \nParticulars  As at September 30 , 2024  As at March 31, 2024  \nInsured Assets (\u20b9 million)  1,39,067.50  117,336.50  \nInsured Assets as % of fixed assets (gross block less land cost)  85.16%  79.43%  \nInsured Assets as % of total assets  72.79%  66.68%  \n \nFor further information, see \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 We may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover our economic \nlosses as well as certain other risks, not covered in our insurance policies, which could adversely affect business, \nresults of operations and financial condition \u201d on page 78. \n \nWe believe that our insurance coverage is in accordance with renewable power industry custom, including the \nterms of and the scope of the coverage provided by such insurance. However, our policies are subject to standard \nlimitations, including with respect  to the maximum amount that can be claimed. Therefore, insurance might not \nnecessarily cover all losses incurred by us and we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur losses or \nsuffer claims beyond the limits of, or outside the relevant coverage  of, our insurance policies.  \n \nHuman Resources:  \n \nWe place importance on developing our human resources. As of September 30, 2024, our workforce comprised \n232 employees, and we utilised the services of 45 contract labourers. Combinations of full -time employees on \nsecondment basis from NTPC Limited and con tract personnel gives us flexibility to run our business and projects \nefficiently.   \n \nAll our employees are on secondment from NTPC Limited. Pay allowances, perquisites and other benefits of the \nemployees are governed by the terms and conditions as per the policy of NTPC Limited. As per the policy amount \nequivalent to a fixed percentage of basic and DA of the seconded employees is payable by us for employee    \n \n \n233 \n \n superannuation benefits such as provident fund, pension, gratuity, post -retirement medical facilities, compensated \nabsences, long service award, economic rehabilitation scheme and other terminal benefits to NTPC Limited.  \n \nThe table below sets forth the number of our employees as of September 30 , 2024:  \n \nDepartments / Teams  Number of employees at  \nSeptember 30 , 2024 (1) \nManagement and administration  26 \nConstruction and development  88 \nOperations and Maintenance  27 \nProcurement  21 \nFinance and accounts  17 \nEnvironmental, health and safety  2 \nIT  2 \nOthers  49 \nTotal  232 \n(1) Does not include 45 contract labourers as at September 30 , 2024.  \n \nOur work force is a critical factor in maintaining quality, productivity and safety, which strengthens our \ncompetitive position. We are committed to provide safe and healthy working conditions. We currently do not have \nany registered trade unions with respect to our business.  \n \nThe following table sets forth our attrition in the periods indicated.  \nParticulars  Six months period  ended  \nSeptember 30 , 2024  Fiscal 2024  Fiscal 2023(1) \nAttrition Rate  4.74%  2.56%  5.33%  \n(1) Our Company was incorporated on April 7, 2022.  \n \nWe offer formal and informal training as well as on -the-job learning.  \n \nCompetition  \n \nWe believe that we do not face significant competition for our operational projects as most of the capacity under \nour projects is contracted to counterparties under long -term, fixed -tariff PPAs with limited termination rights and \na minimum guaranteed volum e. If we develop and/or acquire new projects in the future, in accordance with our \nstrategy, we may compete in the development and acquisition of new projects, as well as in the sale of electricity. \nWe may face competition to acquire new projects at the de velopment stage through bids for long -term PPAs in \ncentral and state power auctions.  \n \nOur primary competitors may include domestic and foreign companies which may have different levels of \nfinancial, operational, marketing, personnel and other resources than us. We may compete with other developers \nbased on a number of factors, including the  sourcing of solar or wind energy projects, reputation and track record, \nrelationship with government authorities, access to capital and control over quality, access to project land, \nefficiency and reliability in project development.  \n \nWe may also compete with both traditional and renewable energy companies for the financing needed to develop \nand construct projects and for refinancing needs. In addition, we may compete with other traditional and renewable \nenergy companies in India for a limited pool of personnel with requisite industry knowledge and experience.  \n \nCompetitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and regulations. Such \nlaws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating projects. If we \nwere to be in competition w ith others in the future, we believe that we will have advantages over our competitors \nwith the NTPC Group\u2019s substantial infrastructure and energy sector experience.  See, \u201c Risk Factors - We face \nsignificant competition from both traditional and renewable energy companies and any failure to respond to    \n \n \n234 \n \n market changes in the renewable energy industry could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and \nresults of operations\u201d on page 44. \n \nFor further information, see \u201c Industry Overview \u201d on page 151. \n \nIntellectual Property Rights  \n \nThe \u201cNTPC\u201d trademark, name and logo do not belong to us, which is registered in the name of our Corporate \nPromoter with the trademark registry.

Accordingly, our \nBoard of Directors has constituted a CSR Committee for carrying out the CSR activities.  \n \nThe table below sets forth the amounts required to be spent on CSR and our actual CSR expenses for the Fiscal \n2024.  \nParticulars  Fiscal 2024 (1) \n\u20b9 million  % of Average Net Profit  \nAmount required to be spent during the period  11.30  2% \nActual expenditure related to CSR spent during the \nyear 11.30  2% \n(1) Based on restated consolidated financial information for Fiscal 2024.  See \u201c Restated Consolidated Financial Information \u201d on page \n282. \n \nSeasonality  of Business  \nThe energy output performance of our solar projects is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight and the ambient \ntemperatures. As a result, our revenue in the past has been impacted by rain and sunlight. Our solar energy output \ndecreases in monsoon seasons due to less sunlight whereas it increases during winter and summer months.  \n \nThe energy output performance of our wind projects is dependent on wind patterns and wind speeds. As a result, \nour revenue in the past has been impacted by wind speeds. Our wind energy output decreases during the \u201cLow \nWind Season\u201d, which generally spans October to March, and increases during the \u201cHigh Wind Season\u201d, which \ngenerally spans April to September i n any given year.  \n \nWe believe that the higher levels of revenue generated during the winter and summer months and High Wind \nSeason can help to mitigate the lower levels of revenue generated during the monsoon seasons and Low Wind \nSeason. Typically, our revenue is the lowest from June to September and highest from January to March of any \ngiven fiscal year.  \n \nFor further details, see \u201cRisk Factors - Our business is seasonal and our operating results may fluctuate from \nperiod to period, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our operating \nresults for a particular period to fall below expectations. \u201d on page 54. \n \n Project Name  Project Location  Owned/  \nLeased (Expiration)  \nBhensada  Rajasthan  Owned/Leased  \nShahapur  Madhya Pradesh  Leased  \nRadhanpur  Gujarat  Owned  \nRojmal  Gujarat  Owned/Leased  \nDayapar -I Gujarat  Owned/Leased     \n \n \n236 \n \n KEY REGULATIONS  AND POLICIES IN INDIA  \nThe following description is an overview of certain laws and regulations in India, which are relevant to our \nCompany, as of the date of this Prospectus.

The statements below are based on the current provisions of Indian law \nand the judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, which are subject to change or modification by \nsubsequ ent legislative, regulatory, administrative or judicial decisions.  \nLaws in relation to our business  \nElectricity Act, 2003  \nThe Electricity Act, 2003 (\u201c Electricity Act \u201d) is the central legislation which covers, amongst others, generation, \ntransmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity. It governs the establishment, operation and maintenance \nof any electricity generating company and prescribes technical stand ards in relation to the connectivity of \ngenerating companies with the grid. As per the provisions of the Electricity Act, generating companies are required \nto establish, operate and maintain generating stations, s ubstations and dedicated transmission lines. Further, the \ngenerating companies may supply electricity to any licensee or even directly to consumers, subject to availing \nopen access to the transmission and distribution systems and payment of transmission ch arges, including wheeling \ncharges and any other open access charges, as may be determined by the concerned electricity regulatory \ncommission.  \nAs per the Electricity Act, the transmission, distribution and trade of electricity are licensed activities that require \nlicenses from Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (\u201c CERC \u201d), concerned State Electricity Regulatory \nCommissions (\u201c SERCs \u201d) or a joint commission (constituted by an agreement entered by two or more state \ngovernments or the central government in relation to one or more state governments, as the case may be). \nHowever, in accordance with Section 7 of the Electricity Act, a gene rating company may establish, operate and \nmaintain a generating station without obtaining a license under the Electricity Act if it complies with the technical \nstandards relating to connectivity with the grid prescribed under clause (b) of Section 73 of the Electricity Act. \nUnder Section 86 of the Electricity Act, the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (\u201cSERCs\u201d) are required to \npromote co -generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy and sale of electrici ty to \nany person from sources other than the incumbent distribution licensee under the provisions of open access. The \nElectricity Act further requires the SERCs to specify, for the purchase of electricity from renewable sources, a \npercentage of the total c onsumption of electricity within the area of a distribution licensee, which has been \nimplemented in the form of renewable purchase obligations (\u201c RPOs \u201d). \nAdditionally, the Electricity Rules, 2005 (the \u201c Electricity Rules \u201d) also prescribe a regulatory framework for \ndeveloping captive generating plants. Pursuant to the Electricity Rules, a power plant shall qualify as a captive \npower plant only if not less than 26% of ownership is held by captive users and not less than 51%  of the aggregate \nelectricity generated in such plant, determined on an annual basis, is consumed for captive use. In case of a \ngenerating station owned by a company formed as a special purpo se vehicle, the equity shares of such special \npurpose vehicle required to be held by the captive user(s) are to be determined with reference to such unit or units \nidentified for captive use and not with reference to the generating station as a whole, and t he electricity required \nto be consumed by the captive user(s) must not be less than 26% of the proportionate equity interest of the \ncompany related to the generating unit or units identified as the captive generating plant.  \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for Tariff Determination from Renewable  \nEnergy Sources) Regulations, 2024  (\u201cTariff Regulations \u201d) \n \nThe Tariff Regulations prescribe the criteria that may be taken into consideration by the CERC while determining  \nthe tariff for the sale of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. The CERC shall determine project -\nspecific tariff for solar PV power projects, based on financial principles such as, inter alia, debt equity ratio, loan \ntenure and interest on loan, interest on working capital and any incentive, grant or subsidy from the Central or \nState Governmen t.    \n \n \n237 \n \n  \nElectricity (Promoting Renewable Energy through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2022 (\u201cElectricity Rules  \n2022\u201d)  \n \nThe Electricity Rules 2022 is applicable to the generation, purchase and consumption of green energy, i.e., \nelectrical energy from renewable sources of energy. It provides in detail for RPOs for entities obligated under the  \nElectricity Act, green energy open access, procedure for the grant of green energy open access, green certificate, \ncharges to be levied on open access and cross -subsidy surcharge. It also provides for tariff for green energy which  \nshall be determined by the appropriate commission. It sha ll comprise of the average pooled power purchase cost  \nof the renewable energy, cross -subsidy charges, if any, and service charges covering the prudent cost of  \ndistribution licensee for providing the green energy.  \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (Indian Electricity Grid Code) Regulations, 2023 (\u201cGrid Code\u201d)  \nThe CERC has recently notified the Grid Code which lays down the rules, guidelines and standards to be followed \nfor stable, reliable and secure grid operation and to achieve maximum economy and efficiency of the power \nsystem. The Grid Code provides for the  role of various statutory bodies, organisations and functional linkages \namong them and in addition, it contains extensive provisions pertaining to reliability and adequacy of resources; \ntechnical and design criteria for connectivity to the grid, protectio n setting and performance monitoring of the \nprotection systems including protection audit; integration of renewables; ancillary services and reserves; and cyber \nsecurity.   \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (Sharing of Inter -State Transmission Charges and Losses) \nRegulations, 2020  \nOn May 4, 2020, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission issued the CERC (Sharing of Inter -State \nTransmission Charges and Losses) Regulations, 2020. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that \ntransmission charges are fully covered, thereby min imizing power losses during interstate transmission. These \nregulations apply to all designated ISTS customers, Inter -state transmission licensees, the national load dispatch \ncentre, regional load dispatch centres, state load dispatch centres, and regional power committees.  \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (Connectivity and General Network Access to the Inter -State \nTransmission System) Regulations, 2022  \nThe CERC (Connectivity and General Network Access to the Inter -State Transmission System) Regulations, 2022 \nhave been introduced in alignment with the \u2018One Nation, One Grid\u2019 concept. These regulations ensure \nnondiscriminatory access to the central transmis sion network for all power producers. When seeking access, \npower producers need only specify the capacity and the time block during which this capacity will be transmitted .  \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission (Deviation Settlement Mechanism and Related Matters) \nRegulations, 2022  \nThe Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Deviation Settlement Mechanism and Related Matters) \nRegulations, 2022 (\u201cDSM Regulations, 2022\u201d), which came into effect on 05th December 2022. The DSM \nRegulations, 2022 have been pivotal in maintaining grid di scipline and security, in line with the objectives outlined \nin the grid code. These regulations establish a commercial mechanism for Deviation Settlement, detailing penalties \nfor both over -injections and under -injections of electricity.  \nPublic Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order for Renewable Energy Sector, 2018 (\u201cMake in India  \nRenewable Energy Order\u201d)  \n \nPursuant to the Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order, 2017 dated June 15, 2017 issued by  the \nDIPP (the \u201cMake in India Order\u201d) to promote the manufacture and production of goods and services in India, the \nMNRE has issued the Make in India Renewable Energy Order on December 11, 2018, directing all departments / \nattached offices / subordinate offices  of the MNRE or autonomous bodies controlled by the Central Government \nor government companies (as defined under the Companies Act, 2013) to adhere to the Make in India Order with \nrespect to all of their procurements. For grid connected solar power project s, apart from civil construction, central \nministries, departments, and central public sector undertakings, are required to give preference to domestically    \n \n \n238 \n \n manufactured components, with solar modules required to be 100% locally manufactured and other components \nsuch as inverters required to be at least 40% locally manufactured. With respect to off grid / decentralized solar \npower, the requirement of local con tent in solar streetlights, solar home lighting systems, solar power packs / \nmicro grid, solar water pumps, inverters, batteries, and any other solar PV balance of system is at least 70%.  \nNational Electricity Policy and the National Electricity Plan  \nThe Central Government approved the National Electricity Policy on February 12, 2005, in accordance with the \nprovisions of the Electricity Act. The National Electricity Policy lays down the guidelines for accelerated \ndevelopment of the power sector, includ ing renewable energy, providing supply of electricity to all areas and \nprotecting interests of consumers and other stakeholders. The National Electricity Policy provides that the SERCs \nmay determine an appropriate pricing differential in tariffs in order t o promote renewable energy technologies, \nuntil such time that non -conventional technologies can compete with conventional sources of energy. It further \nencourages SERCs to increase the share of electricity from non -conventional sources and make RPOs applic able \nfor the tariffs determined by them. The Central Government has further notified the National Electricity Plan, \nVolume I on January 15, 2019 in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act and the National Electricity \nPolicy. The draft Nationa l Electricity Plan Volume II (Transmission) 2022 -27 is under finalization.  \nNational Tariff Policy, 2016  \nIn 2016, the Government issued the National Tariff Policy, 2016 (\u201c NTP 2016 \u201d) which introduced several reforms \nand increased the focus on renewable energy, sourcing power through competitive bidding and the need for \n\u2019reasonable rates\u2019. The objective of NTP 2016, inter -alia, include: (i) ensuring financial viability of the power \nsector and attract investments; (ii) ensuring availability of electricity to consumers at reasonable and competitive \nrates; (iii) promoting generation of electricity from renewable po wer sources; and (iv) promoting hydroelectric \npower generation.  \nThe NTP 2016 has removed the ambiguity on applicability of the renewable purchase obligations (\u201c RPO \u201d) on co -\ngeneration as it has been clarified that cogeneration from sources other than renewable sources shall not be \nexcluded from the applicability of the RPO obligation. NTP 2016 has also provided more clarity of the renewable \ngeneration obligation (\u201c RGO \u201d) provisions. NTP 2016 specifies that the renewable energy produced by each \ngenerator may be bundled with its thermal generation for the purpose of sale. I n case an obligated entity procures \nthis renewable power, then the SERCs will consider the obligated entity to have met the RPO to the extent of \npower bought from such renewable energy generating stations. Given the focus that NTP 2016 has on renewable \npower and competitive tariffs, the States have been mandated to make necessary endeavours to procure power \nfrom renewable energy through competitive bidding to keep the tariff low. Further, NTP 2016 states that 35% of \nthe installed capacity can be procured by  the state at SERC determined tariff. Further to give the much need \nimpetus to the renewable power sector, it has been suggested in the NTP 2016 that the inter -state transmission \ncharges and losses for renewable power (solar / wind) be levied till certain date as may be notified by the \nGovernment of India. NTP 2016, inter alia, takes into account the following factors in determining the tariff: (i) \nReturn on Investment; (ii) Equity norm of 70:30; (iii) Depreciation; (iv) Cost of debt; (v) Cost of management  of \nforeign exchange risk i.e. the costs incurred on account of hedging and swapping to take care of foreign exchange \nvariations; and (vi) Operating norms (to be evolved based on the incentives and disincentives along with \nappropriate arrangement for shari ng the gains of efficient operations with the consumers). NTP 2016 also \ndiscusses the implementation of Multi -Year Tariff Framework, this framework is likely to minimise the risks for \nutilities and consumers, promoter efficiency and appropriate reduction o f system losses and attract investments. \nThe Tariff Policy also empowers the Central Government to notify a tariff framework, allowing for the tariff to \nbe increased progressively in public interest.  \nIntegrated Energy Policy 2006  \nThe Integrated Energy Policy, 2006, (the \u201c Policy \u201d) is a report of an expert committee constituted by the \nGovernment of India, to explore alternative technologies and possible synergies that would increase energy system  \nefficiency and meet the requirement for energy services. The aims and objectives of this Policy include, amongst \nothers, providing appropriate fiscal policies to take care of externalities, tax measures, transparent and targeted \nsubsidies, promoting energy  efficiency, and providing incentives for renewable energy production. The Policy    \n \n \n239 \n \n also provides for the respective power regulators to mandate feed -in laws for renewable energy, as may be \nappropriate and as provided under the Electricity Act.  \nState solar policies  \nOur Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the solar policies framed in the states in which the solar power \nprojects are implemented, and we supply our products to such projects. Such policies typically provide a \nframework for the governance of the solar  power industry and projects, procedures for undertaking of bids, terms  \nof the renewable purchase obligations, connectivity to grid lines and the measures to be taken to promote the \ndevelopment of solar power in the state, including incentives to manufactu rer such as grants of concessions on  \ncertain taxes, research and development initiatives.  \nSolar Park Scheme  \nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (\u201cMNRE\u201d) has drawn a scheme to set up number of solar parks \nacross various states in the country, each with a capacity of Solar Projects generally above 500 MW. The Scheme \nproposes to provide financial support by Go vernment of India to establish solar parks with an aim to facilitate \ncreation of infrastructure necessary for setting up new solar power projects in terms of allocation of land, \ntransmission and evacuation lines, access roads, availability of water and oth ers, in a focused manner.  \nThe Solar Park is a concentrated zone of development of solar power generation projects. As part of Solar Park \ndevelopment, land required for development of Solar Power Projects with cumulative capacity generally 500 MW \nand above will be identified and acq uired and various infrastructure like transmission system, water, road \nconnectivity and communication network etc. will be developed. The parks will be characterized by well -\ndeveloped proper infrastructure where the risk & gestation period of the projects will be minimized. At the state \nlevel, the solar park will enable the states to bring in significant investment from project developers in the Solar \nPower sector, to meet its Solar Purchase Obligation (\u201cSPO\u201d) mandates and provide employment opportunities t o \nlocal population. The state will also be able to reduce its carbon footprint by avoiding emissions equivalent to the \nsolar park\u2019s generated capacity.  \nEnvironmental laws  \nEnvironment Protection Act, 1986 (the \u201cEP Act\u201d) and the Environment Protection Rules, 1986 (the \u201cEP  \nRules\u201d) read with the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 (\u201cEIA Notification\u201d)  \n \nThe EP Act has been enacted with the objective of protection and improvement of the environment and for matters  \nconnected therewith. As per the EP Act, the Central Government has been given the power to take all such \nmeasures for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and to prevent, control and \nabate environmental pollution. Further,  the Central Government has been given the power to give directions in \nwriting to any person or officer or any authority for any of the purposes  of the EP Act, including the power to \ndirect the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation, or process. The EP Rules prescribes the \nstandards for emission or discharge of environmental pollutants from industries, operations, or process es, \nprohibitions and restrictions on the location of industries as well as prohibitions and restrictions on the handling  \nof hazardous substances in different areas for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the \nenvironment and preventing an d abating environmental pollution. Additionally, under the EIA Notification and \nits subsequent amendments, projects are required to mandatorily obtain environmental clearance from the \nconcerned authorities depending on the spatial extent of potential impac ts and potential impact on human health  \nand natural and manmade resources.  \nWater (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (the \u201cWater Act\u201d)  \nThe Water Act provides for the prevention and control of water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of \nwholesomeness of water, and the establishment of the Central Pollution Control Board, as well as state pollution  \ncontrol boards (\u201c State PCB \u201d), to implement its provisions, including to lay down standards of treatment of sewage  \nand trade effluents. The Water Act prohibits the use of any stream or well for the disposal of polluting matter, in \nviolation of the standards set down by the State PCB. The Wa ter Act also provides that the consent of the State \nPCB must be obtained prior to establishing any industry, operation or process, or opening of any new outlets,    \n \n \n240 \n \n which are likely to discharge sewage effluent. The Water Act prescribes specific amounts of fine and terms of \nimprisonment for various contraventions.  \nAir (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 (the \u201cAir Act\u201d)  \nThe Air Act provides for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution. Under the Air Act, the State \nGovernment may, after consultation with the relevant state pollution control board declare, by notification in the \nOfficial Gazette, any area or a reas within the state as air pollution control area or areas for the purposes of the Air  \nAct. Pursuant to the provisions of the Air Act, any person establishing or operating any industrial plant within an \nair pollution control area, must obtain the consent  of the relevant state pollution control board prior to establishing  \nor operating such industrial plant. Further, no person operating any industrial plant in any air pollution control \narea shall discharge or permit or cause to be discharged the emission of any air pollutant in excess of the standards  \nlaid down by the state pollution control board. The Air Act prescribes specific amounts of fine and terms of \nimprisonment for various contraventions.  \nHazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 (the \u201cHazardous \nWaste Rules\u201d)  \nThe Hazardous Waste Rules regulate the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. Under  \nthe Hazardous Waste Rules, \u201chazardous waste\u201d inter alia means any waste which by reason of characteristics such \nas physical, chemical, biological, reactive, toxic, flammable, explosive or corrosive, causes danger or is likely to \ncause danger to health or environment, whether alone or in contact with other wastes or substances.  Every occupier \nof a facility generating hazardous waste must obtain authorization from the relevant state pollution control board. \nFurther, the occupier, importer or exporter, or operator of a disposal facility is liable for damages caused to the \nenvironm ent or third party resulting from the improper handling and management and disposal of hazardous waste \nand shall be liable to pay any financial penalty that may be levied by the respective state pollution control board \nfor violation of the Hazardous Waste Rules.  \nLabour laws  \nFactories Act, 1948  \nThe Factories Act, 1948, as amended (the \u201cFactories Act\u201d), defines a \u201cfactory\u201d to cover any premises which \nemploys or had employed 10 or more workers on any day of the preceding 12 months and in which a \nmanufacturing process is carried on with the aid of p ower or any premises where at least 20 workers are or were  \nemployed on any day of the preceding 12 months, and where a manufacturing process is carried on without the \naid of power. Each State Government has enacted rules in respect of the prior submission of plans and their \napproval for the establishment of factories and registration/licensing thereof. The Factories Act provides for \nimposition of fines and imprisonment of the manager and occupier of the factory in case of any contravention of  \nthe provisions of the Factories Act.  \nContract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970  \nThe Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 (\u201cCLRA\u201d) regulates the employment of contract \nlabour in certain establishments. The CLRA provides that the appropriate Government may, after consultation \nwith the Central or State Advisory Boards (co nstituted under the CLRA), prohibit employment of contract labour \nin any process, operation or other work in any establishment.  \nShops and establishments legislations  \nUnder the provisions of local shops and establishments legislations applicable in the states in India where our \nestablishments are set up and business operations exist, such establishments are required to be registered. Such \nlegislations regulate the worki ng and employment conditions of the workers employed in shops and \nestablishments, including commercial establishments, and provide for fixation of working hours, rest intervals, \novertime, holidays, leave, termination of service, maintenance of records, mai ntenance of shops and \nestablishments and other rights and obligations of the employers and employees.

Even though the reconciliation statements are prepared quarterly and signed by the Holding Company and \ncustomer (trade receivables), balance confirmation letters are not being sent to customers.

As per Ind AS 16 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d (\u201cPPE\u201d), Items of spare parts, stand -by equipment and \nservicing equipment which meet the definition of PPE are to be capitalized. Even though procedure exists for \nidentification / codification of such items, however, no item -wise consolidated list of such identified items, \nhas been prepared by the Holding Company.

Against the above said EAC opinion, the company classified this grant un der \u2018Cash \nFlow from Financing Activities,\u2019 instead of under \u2018Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\u2019  \nThis resulted in overstatement of \u2018Cash Flow from Financing Activities\u2019 and understatement of \u2018Cash Flow \nfrom Investing Activities\u2019 by \u20b9  6,403.25 Million each.  \n \niii) Auditor\u2019s Report on Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 202 3  \n \nA.

Current and non -current classification  \nThe Group classifies its assets and liabilities as current/non -current in the balance sheet considering \n12 months period as normal operating cycle .  \nC. Material  accounting policies  \nA summary of the material  accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Restated \nconsolidated financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied \nconsistently to all periods presented in the Restated consolidated financial statements.  \n \n1. Basis of consolidation  \nThe financial statements of subsidiary companies and joint venture companies are drawn up to the \nsame reporting date as of the Company for the purpose of consolidation.  \n1.1. Subsidiaries  \nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power  to direct the relevant activities of the investee. \nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Group and are continued to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.  \nNon-controlling interests (NCI) are measured initially at their proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s \nidentifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.  A change in the Group\u2019s interest in a subsidiary that do \nnot result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions  \nChanges in the Group\u2019s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.  \nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the contr ol is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is \nrecognized in statement of profit and loss. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities of the subsidiary i.e. reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss or transferred to equity as specified by applicable Ind AS. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.  \n1.2. Joint ventures  \nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing contro l. \nInterests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.  \n Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted \nthereafter to recognize the Group\u2019s share of the post -acquisition profits or losses of the investee in \nprofit and loss, and the Group\u2019s share of other comprehensive income (OCI) of the investee in OCI. Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.  \n301W\nhen the Group\u2019s share of losses in an equity- accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest \nin the entity, which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of Group investment \nin joint venture, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Losses recognized using the equity method in excess of the entity\u2019s investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the e ntity\u2019s interest in an associate or a joint venture in the reverse order of their \nseniority i.e. priority in liquidation.  \n \nThe statement of profit and loss reflects the Group\u2019 share of results of operations of the joint venture. Any change in the OCI of those investee is presented as presented as part of the Group OCI. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the \nextent of the Group\u2019s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. When necessary, adjustments are made to the fi nancial statements of joint ventures to bring their accounting policies \ninto line with the Group\u2019s accounting policies.  \nThe carrying amount of equity accounted as investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in D. 7 below.  \nWhen the Group ceases to apply equity method of accounting for an investment because of a loss of joint control, any retained interest in the entity is re -measured to its fair value with the change in \ncarrying amount recognized in statement of profit and l oss. This fair value becomes the initial \ncarrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the  Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that \namounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.  \nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture is reduced but joint control is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.  \n \n2. Property, plant and equipment  \n2.1. Initial recognition and measurement  \nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item \ncan be measured reliably.  \nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost..  Subsequent measurement is \ndone at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.  \nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have \ndifferent useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.  \nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other \nexpenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.  \nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, capitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.  \nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering estimates/assessments.  \nItems of spare parts, stand -by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of \n302p\nroperty, plant and equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and \nrecognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss on consumption.  \n \nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly \nincreasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for the Group to obtain future economic benefits from its other assets. \nSuch items are recognized as property, plant and equipment.  \nExcess of net sale proceed of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is deducted from the directly attributable cost considered as part of an item of property, plant and equipment.  \n \n2.2. Subsequent costs  \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that \nfuture economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  \nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the \nreplaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the Group uses the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day- to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment \nare recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.\n \n2.3. De-recognition \nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de -recognition of an item of property, plant and \nequipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and \nloss. \n2.4. \nDepreciation/amortization  \nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business covered under Part B of Schedule \nII of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straight -line method following the rates and \nmethodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commi ssion (CERC) Tariff Regulations.  \nDepreciation on the assets of the power plants and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Company not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations is charged on straight -line method following \nthe useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below. \nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different \nfrom the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on \nthe basis of technical evaluation/ assessment:  \na)  Kutcha roads  2 years  \nb)  Enabling works - Enabling works  \u2013 residential and non -residential buildings, \nincluding their internal electrification, water supply, sewerage & drainage works, \nhelipads and airstrips  5-15 years  \nc)  Personal computers & laptops including peripherals . 3 years  \nd)  Temporary erections including wooden structures . 1 year  \n303e) Energy saving electrical appliances and fittings . 2-7 years  \nf) Solar/ wind power plants  which are not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations.  25 years  \ng) Furniture, Fixture, Office equipment and Communication equipment  5-15 years  \nCapital spares are depreciated considering the useful life up to 25 years based on technical \nassessment.  \nRight-of- use land and buildings relating to generation of electricity business which are not governed \nby CERC tariff Regulations are fully amortized on straight line method over the lease period or life \nof the related plant whichever is lower.  \nDepreciation on additions to/deductions from property, plant and equipment during the year is charged on pro- rata basis from/up to the month in which the asset is available for use/sale, disposal \nor earmarked for disposal.  \nWhere it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the expenditure incurred will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably, subsequent expenditure on a property, \nplant and equipment along- with its unamortized depreciable amount is charged off prospectively \nover the revised useful life determined by technical assessment.  \nThe residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation of assets other than the assets of generation of electricity business governed by CERC Tariff Regulations, are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.  \nDepreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with Ind AS 105 and the date that the asset is derecognized.  \nRefer policy no. C.14 in respect of depreciation/amortization of right -of-use assets other than land \nand buildings.  \n3. Capital work -in-progress  \nCost incurred for property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as on the \nreporting date, is classified under capital work- in-progress.  \nThe cost of self -constructed assets includes the cost of materials & direct labour, any other costs \ndirectly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable \nof operating in the manner intended by management and the borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying asset.  \nExpenses directly attributable to construction of property, plant and equipment incurred till they are ready for their intended use are identified and allocated on a systematic basis on the cost of related assets.  \nDeposit works/cost plus contracts are accounted for on the basis of statements of account received from the contractors.  \nUnsettled liabilities for price variation /exchange rate variation  in case of contracts are accounted \nfor on estimated basis as per terms of the contracts . \n4. Intangible assets and intangible assets under development  \n4.1. Initial recognition and measurement  \nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Group , which have finite useful lives, are recognized at \ncost. Subsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated \nimpairment losses.  \n4.2. Subsequent costs\n \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is \n304pr\nobable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise \nand the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  \n4.3. De-recognition \nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use \nor upon their disposal. Gain or loss on de -recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the \ndifference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the statement of profit an d loss.  \n4.4. Amortization \nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight -line method over a period \nof legal right to use or 3 years, whichever is less.   \nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.  \n5. Borrowing costs  \nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in Ind AS 109 \u2013 \u2018Financial Instruments\u2019 (b) interest expense on lease liabilities  \nrecognized in accordance with Ind AS 116\u2013 \u2018Leases\u2019 .   \nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ \ndevelopment or erection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.  \nWhen the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the \nborrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Group borrows funds generally and uses them for \nthe purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, \nborrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a \nqualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.  \nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for \nexpenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.  \nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare \nthe qualifying assets for their intended use are complete.  \nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred \nThe \nGroup  can incur borrowing costs during an extended period in which it suspends the activities \nnecessary to prepare an asset for its intended use or sale. Such costs are costs of holding partially \ncompleted assets and is not eligible for capitalisation. However, the Group  does not normally \nsuspend capitalising borrowing costs during a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work. The \nGroup  also does not suspend capitalising borrowing costs when a \ntemporary delay is a necessary  part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended use or \nsale. \n6. Inventories  \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on weighted \naverage basis.  \nNon-moving items of stores and spares are reviewed and diminution in the value of obsolete, \n305uns\nerviceable, surplus spares is ascertained and provided for.  \n7. Government grants  \nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received \nand the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate \nthe Group for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss \non a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which the related \ncosts are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses.  \n8. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets  \nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group  has a present legal or constructive \nobligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits \nwill be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre -tax rate that reflects \ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.  \nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.  \nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be \nrecovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.  \nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more future events not wholly \nwithin the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on  the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at \neach balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.  \nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be \nconfirmed only by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not \nwholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements \nwhen inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are \nassessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements.  \nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable \ncosts of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.  \n9. Foreign currency transactions and translation  \nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.  \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the reporting date are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange prevailing on that  date. Exchange \n306d\nifferences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of \nprofit and loss in the year in which it arises . \nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical \ncost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  \nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a \nhyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:  \n \u2022 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet  \n \u2022 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable \napproximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and  \n \u2022 All resulting exchange differences are recognized in OCI.  \n \n10. Revenue \nGroup\u2019s revenues arise from sale of energy , consultancy, project management & supervision \nservices,  and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, contractors \netc., dividend from investments in joint venture & subsidiary companies, surcharge received from \nbeneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.  \n \n10.1. Revenue from sale of energy  \nA portion of Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the \nCERC. In such cases, Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved \nby the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.  Revenue from sale of energy is recognized \nonce the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review \nof usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each reporting date, \nrevenue from  sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries but not yet billed \ni.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.  \nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries  and trading of power \nthrough power exchanges.  \nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.  \nRevenue from sale of energy saving certificates/carbon credits is accounted for as and when sold.  \n10.2. Revenue from services  \nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when the performance obligation \nis satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a customer.  \nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.  \n307C\nontract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either \nto the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves \nassessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate \ncontract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of \nthe existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.  \n \n10.3. Other income \nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability \nexist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate , using the effective interest rate method (EIR).  For debt instruments measured either at \namortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income  (OCI), interest income is \nrecognized using the EIR  to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset  and included in other \nincome in the statement of profit and l oss. For purchased or originated credit -impaired (POCI) \nfinancial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit -adjusted EIR and applying \nthat rate to the amortized cost of the asset.   \nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance \nclaims are accounted for based on certainty of realization.  \nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized \nwhen no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.  \nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims wherever there is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are therefore, accounted for on receipt/acceptance.  \nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss only when the right to receive is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group , and the \namount of the dividend can be measured reliably.  \n11. Employee benefits  \nThe employees of the Group are on secondment from NTPC Limited (the parent company). \nEmployee benefits include provident fund, pension, gratuity, post -retirement medical facilities, \ncompensated absences, long service award, economic rehabilitation scheme and other terminal \nbenefits . In terms of arrangement with the Parent Company, the Group is required to make a fixed \npercentage contribution of the aggregate of basic pay and dearness allowance for the period of \nservice rendered in the Group. Accordingly, these employee benefits are treated as defined \ncontribution schemes.  \n12. Other expenses  \nExpenses on training & recruitment are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year \nincurred. \nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility \nreport/techno economic clearance/winning of project under tender based competitive bidding system are charged to statement of profit and loss.  \nNet pre- commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and \nsystems.  \n13. Income tax  \nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in \nstatement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or \n308e\nquity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.  \nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the \nprovisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of \nthe reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  \nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes \nlevied by the same tax authority.  \nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.  \nDeferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred \ntax liability  arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction \nthat is not a business combination and,  at the time of transaction, (i) affects neither accounting nor \ntaxable profit or loss and (ii) does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.  \nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.  \nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax \nauthority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognised. The effect of the uncertainty is recognised using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Group evaluates whether to consider \neach uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.  \n14. Leases  \nAs lessee  \nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or \ncontains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period \nof time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether  a contract conveys the right to control the \nuse of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an \nidentified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset \nthrough the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.  \n \nThe Group recognizes a right -of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease \narrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short \nterm leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short -term and leases for low \nvalue underlying assets, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a \nstraight- line basis over the term of the lease.  \n \nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. Right -of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain \nthat the option to extend the lease will be exer cised/option to terminate the lease will not be \nexercised.  \n \n309T\nhe right -of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which \ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior \nto the commencement date of the lease plus any initial dire ct costs less any lease incentives. They \nare subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities  \n Right-of- use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the useful \nlife of the underlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of \nlease term or if the cost of right-of- use assets reflects  that the purchase option will be exercised. \nOtherwise, Right -of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date on a \nstraight- line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.  \n \nRight-of- use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, \nthe recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value -in-use) \nis determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash G enerating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n \n \nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease \npayments. In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate \nimplicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, us ing the incremental borrowing rate. Lease \nliabilities are re -measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right -of-use asset if the \nGroup changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.  \n \n15. Impairment of non -financial assets  \nThe carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s non- financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to \ndetermine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - \n\u2018Impairment of Assets\u2019. If any such indication exists, then the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated.  \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash -generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs \nof disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre -tax discount rate that reflects current market \nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the \u2018cash- generating unit\u2019, or \u201cCGU\u201d).  \nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.  \nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.  \n \n16. Operating segments  \nIn accordance with Ind AS 108- \u2018Operating segments\u2019, the operating segments used to present \n310s\negment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Group\u2019s management \nto allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is \ncollectively the Group\u2019s \u2018Chief Operating Decision Maker\u2019 or \u2018CODM\u2019 within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.  \n17. Dividends  \nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Group\u2019s shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period  in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors \nrespectively . \n18. Material prior period errors  \nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior periods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest \nperiod presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.  \n19. Earnings per share  \nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity \nshareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the \nfinancial year.  \nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity \nshareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving \nbasic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.  \nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year . \n20. Statement of cash flows  \nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS \n7-\u2018Statement of cash flows\u2019.  \n21. Financial instruments  \nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial \nliability or equity instrument of another entity. The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial \nliability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument . \n21.1. Financial assets  \nInitial recognition and measurement  \nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.  \nSubsequent measurement  \nDebt instruments at amortized cost   \nA \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:  \n(a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and  \n(b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments \n311of\n principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.  \nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using \nthe effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that a re an integral part of the EIR. The EIR \namortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and othe r receivables.  \nBusiness model assessment  \nThe Group holds financial assets which arise from its ordinary course of business. The objective of \nthe business model for these financial assets  is to collect the amounts due from the Group\u2019s \nreceivables and to earn contractual interest income on the amounts collected.  \nInvestment in Equity instruments  \nEquity investments in subsidiaries  and joint venture companies  are accounted at cost less \nimpairment, if any.  \nThe Group reviews the carrying value of investments at each reporting date to determine whether \nthere is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the investment is estimated. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \nDe-recognition \nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar \nfinancial assets) is primarily de -recognized (i.e. removed from the Group\u2019s balance sheet) when:  \n\u2022 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or  \n\u2022 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an \nobligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \n\u2018pass -through\u2019 arrangement\u037e and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks \nand rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all \nthe risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.  \nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \nImpairment of financial assets  \nIn accordance with Ind AS 109- \u2018Financial instruments\u2019, the Group applies expected credit loss \n(ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:  \n(a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits and bank balance.  \n(b) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.  \n(c) Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.  \n \nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Group applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial recognition.  \n \nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure  (other than purchased \nor originated credit impaired financial assets) , the Group  determines that whether there has been a \nsignificant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit  risk has not increased \nsignificantly, 12 -month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has \nincreased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the \n312i\nnstrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial \nrecognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12 month \nECL.  \nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition.  \n \n21.2. Financial liabilities  \nInitial recognition and measurement  \nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, i n the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized \ncost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Group\u2019s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings.  \n \nSubsequent measurement  \nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:  \nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost  \nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of  profit and  loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amort ization process Amortized cost is \ncalculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other contractual liabilities.\n \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held fo r trading if they are incurred for the purpose of \nrepurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  \nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair v alue of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Group has not \ndesignated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.  \nDe-recognition \nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an exist ing liability are substantially modified, such \nan exchange or modification is treated as the de -recognition of the original liability and the \n313r\necognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in \nthe statement of profit and loss.  \n21.3. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities  \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance \nsheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.  \n22. Non -Current Assets Held for Sale  \nThe Group classifies non -current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts \nwill be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.  \nManagement  must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as \na completed  sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required \nto complete  the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan \nwill be made  or that the plan will be withdrawn.  \nNon-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying \namount and the fair value less cost of disposal .  \nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets once  classified as held for sale are not \ndepreciated or amortized.  \nIn circumstances, where an item of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset is \npermanently abandoned and retired from active use, however criteria of \u2018non- current assets held \nfor sale\u2019 as above are not met, such items are not classified as held f or sale and continued to be \ndepreciated over their revised useful lives, as assessed. Such assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with material accounting policy no. C.14 . \nD. Use of estimates and management judgments  \nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, \nliabilities, revenue , expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as \ncontingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management\u2019s judgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  \nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.  \nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recogni zed in the financial statements is as under:  \n1. Formulation of accounting policies  \nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect  of applying them is immaterial.  \n2. Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a \nnumber of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.  \n3143. R\necoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates \nand assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions  may have a material impact on \nthe measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.  \n4. Revenues  \nThe Group records a part of revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.  \n5. Leases not in legal form of lease   \nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Group, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement  meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.  \n6. Provisions and contingencies  \nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with Ind AS 37, - \u2018Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\u2019. The \nevaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment  by management \nregarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.  \n7. Impairment test of investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Companies  \nThe recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries and joint venture companies is based on \nestimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Group. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on \nthe measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.  \n8. Income taxes  \nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.  \n \n***** \n315NTPC GREEN ENERGY LIMITED\nAmount in \u20b9 Million\nNet block       \nAs  at Deductions/ As at As at For Deductions/ Upto As at\n1 April 2024 Additions adjustments 30 Sep 2024 1 April 2024 the period   adjustments 30 Sep 2024 30 Sep 2024\n4,399.19         401.36          -

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously\nmonitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\nThe Group\u2019s Treasury department is responsible for managing the short-term and long-term liquidity requirements of the Group. Short-term liquidity situation\nis reviewed daily by the Treasury department.

Theyare therefore not subject to interest rate risk, since neither the carrying amount nor the future\ncash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates\nA change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below.

Group Information and Material Accounting Policy Information (NTPC RE Group) \nA. Background \nNTPC Limited (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cNTPC\u201d) is a Company domiciled in India and limited \nby shares (CIN: L40101DL1975GOI007966).

Further, the \nCompany was also to transfer its 100% equity shareholding held in NTPC Renewable \nEnergy Limited (\u201cNREL\u201d) at cost, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to NGEL \nthrough a share purchase agreement dated 8 July,  2022.  Pursuant to the above, the \ntransfer of the RE assets and 100% equity shareholding in NREL, to NGEL, were \ncompleted on 28 February 2023. \nThe special purpose carved out combined financial statements comprise the financial \nstatements of 15 Renewable Energy (RE) Assets of the Company, NTPC Renewable \nEnergy Limited (NREL), a wholly owned subsidiary of NGEL and NGEL- (collectively \nreferred as NTPC RE Group).  This special purpose carved out combined financial \nstatements of NTPC RE Group  for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 \n(\u201cSpecial Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements\u201d) have been prepared as \nper the 'Basis of preparation' and for the purposes as set out in Note B below. B. Basis of preparation \nThis Special Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance \nwith the Guidance Note on Combined and Carve-Out Financial Statements (\u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued \nby the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u201cICAI\u201d) to reflect the state of affairs,  profit,  \nstatement of  the changes in  equity/owner\u2019s net investment and  cash flows  of the NTPC RE Group \nfor the respective years, for use in relation to the preparation of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus, \nRed Herring Prospectus and a Prospectus and any other documents in relation to the IPO (as defined \nherein after) (together, the \u201cOffer Document\u201d) to be filed by NGEL with the Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India (SEBI), BSE Limited (\u201cBSE\u201d),  National Stock Exchange (\u201cNSE\u201d) (together with \nBSE the \u201cStock Exchanges\u201d) and Registrar of Companies (RoC), NCT of Delhi and Haryana in \nconnection with the proposed initial public offer of equity shares (\u201cIPO\u201d) of NGEL..  \nThe Special Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements includes the carve-out business in \nrespect of 15 Solar/Wind units (part of the standalone financial statements of NTPC till February 28, \n2023) (the \u201cCarve-Out Business\u201d) which has been combined with the standalone financial statements \nof NREL for the year ended March 31, 2022 and Consolidated  Financial Statements  of NGEL  for \nthe  year ended March 31, 2023 (the Carve-Out Business, NREL and NGEL hereinafter collectively \nreferred to as the \u201cCombining Businesses\u201d) . The details of the Combining Businesses stated above \nare as follows: \n376   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs per the Guidance Note, the procedure for preparing combined financial statements of the \nCombining Businesses is the same as that for consolidated financial statements as per the \napplicable Indian Accounting Standards. The information presented in the Special Purpose \nCarved Out Combined Financial Statements may not be representative of the position which has \nprevailed after the transaction in relation to transfer of RE Assets and investment in NREL. The \nresulting financial position may not be that which might have existed if the Combining \nBusinesses had been a stand-alone business. \nThe Special Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements have been prepared on a \ngoing concern basis considering the material accounting policies stated below. \nThe procedure followed for the preparation of the Special Purpose Carved Out Combined \nFinancial Statements is as given below: \n(a) The financial information for the NTPC RE Group included in the Special Purpose Carved \nOut Combined Financial Statements have been extracted from the audited standalone \nfinancial statements of NTPC,  NREL and Consolidated  Financial Statements of NGEL to \nthe extent considered necessary,  for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 \nas applicable, which had been prepared basis in accordance Indian Accounting Standards \n('Ind AS') notified under the Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (\u2018the Act\u2019) and other \ngenerally accepted accounting principles in India.  \n \n(b) Since these Special Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements have been \nprepared for use in connection with the proposed IPO of NGEL as stated above, the same Sl \nNo. Combining Businesses Description of Activities \n Carve-Out Business - Solar/ Wind Units \n(Under NTPC till 28.02.23)  \n1 Rojmal Power Generation \u2013 Wind \n2 Mandsaur  Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n3 Bhadla Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n4 Ananthpur  Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n5 Rajgarh Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n6 Bilhaur-1 Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n7 Bilhaur-2 Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n8 Jetsar Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n9 Shimbhoo Ka Bhurj -1 Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n10 Shimbhoo Ka Bhurj -2 Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n11 Fatehgarh  Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n12 Devikot-1 Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n13 Devikot-2 Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n14 Ettayapuram  Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n15 Nokhra Power Generation \u2013 Solar \n  Subsidiary of NTPC   \n16 NREL -  Direct Subsidiary of NTPC till \n28.02.23 and Subsidiary of NGEL \nsubsequently Power Generation -  non-\nconventional / renewable energy \nsources such as wind,  and solar or \nany other non conventional form  \n17 NGEL w.e.f. 7 April 2022 Power Generation -  non-\nconventional / renewable energy \nsources such as wind,  and solar or any other non conventional form  \n377   \n \nhas been presented based on the latest audited Consolidated Financial Statements of NGEL \nand has been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies applied therein. Refer \nNote No.35 for adjustments in this regard.  \n \n(c) The historical costs and expenses reflected in the Special Purpose Carved Out Combined \nFinancial Statements  include an  allocation for certain corporate and shared service \nfunctions   are based on the individual unit level financial statements  wherein the same \nhave been allocated either on the basis of actual usage when identifiable or on such other \nbasis which provides a reasonable reflection of the historical utilisation levels of these \nservices. \n \n(d) In terms of BTA, the following assets and liabilities of the Carve Out Business are excluded \nfrom the scope of the business transfer  and has accordingly not been included in the \nSpecial Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements. \na. Land situated in Bilhaur \nb. Employee related balances (loans, advances, deferred payroll expenses, employee \nrelated payables, remeasurement of defined benefit plans forming part of other \nequity) \nc. Tax related balances  \n(e) Trade receivables and borrowings including interest accrued relating to the Carve Out \nBusiness, which were accounted centrally in the SAP Business Area relating to Corporate \nCentre of NTPC has been specifically identified and incorporated at their respective year \nend carrying values in the financial information included in the Special Purpose Carved Out \nCombined Financial Statements, with corresponding adjustment in the Owner\u2019s Net \nInvestment. The borrowings do not form part of liabilities that have been transferred.  \n \n(f) Approval for assignment/novation of right-of-use land pertaining to Rojmal project  and \nJetsar project (part of the Carve-Out Business) is  yet to be consented by the lessor, pending \nwhich the carrying value of right-of-use land net of the corresponding lease liabilities  \npertaining to Rojmal project and Jetsar project have been included under other non- current \nassets post transfer of RE assets pursuant to the BTA and presented accordingly  in the \nSpecial Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements. \n \n(g) Deferred Tax liability in respect of the Carve-Out Business has been determined \nconsidering the applicability of various provisions of the Income Tax Act and having regard \nto the expert opinion obtained in this regard, which has been appropriately recognised in the \nSpecial Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements, with corresponding \nadjustment in the Owner\u2019s Net Investment.  \n \n(h)  Since these statements have been prepared on carve out combined basis, it is not  \nmeaningful to show a share capital or provide an analysis of reserves for the period prior to \nthe date of incorporation of NGEL.  Other Equity (representing owner\u2019s investment) \ndisclosed in the Special Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements therefore \nrepresents the difference between the assets and liabilities pertaining to the NTPC RE \nGroup, duly adjusted for the balances carried in reserves and surplus. The balance in \nreserves and surplus  represents retained earnings pertaining to the Combining Businesses \nwhich has been determined based on the closing balances as of March 31, 2021 duly \nadjusted for the profit including other comprehensive income for the respective financial \nyear.  \n \n(i) The equity share capital of NGEL as at March, 31, 2023 is \u20b9 47196.11 million represented \nby 471,96,11,035 shares of par value \u20b9 10/- each which were allotted to NTPC in the month \n378   \n \nof March 2023.  Since the Statement of Profit & Loss presents the operating results for the \nentire financial year, it is not practical to determine and disclose the earnings per share in \nthe Special Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial Statements. \n \n(j) For the limited purpose of preparation of the Statement of Cash Flows  for the year ended \nMarch 31, 2022, a Carved Out Combined Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2021 has been \nprepared by the management based on information extracted from the audited financials of \nrespective entities.  \n \nManagement believes the assumptions underlying the Special Purpose Carved Out Combined \nFinancial Statements including the assumptions regarding the allocation of general corporate \nexpenses, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the Special Purpose Carved Out Combined Financial \nStatements  may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had it been \noperated as a standalone company during the periods presented and may not reflect the combined \nresults of operations, financial position and cash flows had it operated as a standalone company \nduring the periods presented, since the actual costs that would have been incurred if it had been \noperated as a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organisational \nstructure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and \ninfrastructure and other additional costs. \nEvents occurring after the date of approval of the financial statements of NTPC, NGEL and NREL \nfor the respective years, if any, have not been adjusted in the Special Purpose Carved Out \nCombined Financial Statements. These carved out combined financials have been prepared on a carved out basis to present the \nassets and liabilities of the NTPC RE Group at these dates, as if the Group had been in \nexistence as at these dates. As a result, these financial statements may not be suitable for any \nother purpose.  \n \n1. Basis of measurement \nThe carved out combined financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except \nfor: \n\uf0b7 Certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value (refer serial no. C.21 of \naccounting policy regarding financial instruments). \nThe methods used to measure fair values are discussed in notes to the financial statements. \n2. Functional and presentation currency \nThese carved out combined financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (\u20b9) which is the \nCompany\u2019s functional currency. All financial information presented in Indian Rupees (\u20b9) has been \nrounded to the nearest million (upto two decimals), except when indicated otherwise. \n \n3. Current and non-current classification \nThe Group classifies its assets and liabilities as current/non-current in the balance sheet \nconsidering 12 months period as normal operating cycle.  \n \n4. Approval of these financial statements \n379   \n \nThe special purpose carved out combined financial statements of the NTPC RE Group  were \napproved for issue by the Board of Directors of NTPC in its meeting held  on 29 August 2024, on \nwhich an audit report dated 29 August 2024 has been issued. Subsequently, these financial \nstatements has been approved by the Board of Directors of NGEL on 9 September, 2024 for use \nin relation to the preparation of Offer Document  to be filed by NGEL with the  SEBI, the Stock \nExchanges and RoC NCT of Delhi and Haryana in connection with the proposed  IPO of  its \nequity shares. \n \nC. Material accounting policies \nA summary of the material accounting policies applied in the preparation of the carved out \ncombined financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied \nconsistently to all periods presented in the carved out combined financial statements.  \n1. Basis of consolidation \nThe carved out combined financial statements of the NTPC RE Group have been prepared \nby applying the Guidance note referred above. While applying the above guidance, \nfinancial statements / information of the entities have been combined on the following \nbasis: \na) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of \nthe combining businesses; \nb) Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains/losses on transactions \nbetween the entities in the group are eliminated; \nc) Disclose non-controlling interest where 100% shares are not held. \n Carved Out Combined financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting \npolicies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.  \n2.

Initial recognition and measurement   \nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that \nfuture economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the \nitem can be measured reliably. \nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement \nis done at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses. \nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have \ndifferent useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately. \nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other \nexpenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land. \nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, \ncapitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final \nsettlement. \nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of \nengineering estimates/assessments. \nItems of spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of \nproperty, plant and equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and \nrecognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss on consumption. \n380   \n \n \nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not \ndirectly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant \nand equipment, may be necessary for the Group to obtain future economic benefits from its other \nassets. Such items are recognized as property, plant and equipment. \nExcess of net sale proceed of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition \nnecessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is deducted \nfrom the directly attributable cost considered as part of an item of property, plant and equipment. \n2.2. Subsequent costs \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that \nfuture economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of \nthe item can be measured reliably.  \nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the \ncarrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the \npart will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the \nreplaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated \nseparately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the Group \nuses the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of replaced part was at the time it \nwas acquired or constructed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and \nequipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.  \n2.3. De-recognition \nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected \nfrom their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de-recognition of an item of property, \nplant and equipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, \nand the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of \nprofit and loss. \n2.4. Depreciation/amortization  \nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business covered under Part B of \nSchedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straight-line method following the rates \nand methodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff \nRegulations. \nDepreciation on the assets of the power plants and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of \nthe Company not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations is charged on straight-line method \nfollowing the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets \nreferred below. \nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are \ndifferent from the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, \nascertained on the basis of technical evaluation/ assessment: \na)  Kutcha roads 2 years \nb)  Enabling works- Enabling works \u2013 residential and non-residential buildings, \nincluding their internal electrification, water supply, sewerage & drainage works, \nhelipads and airstrips 5-15 years \nc)  Personal computers & laptops including peripherals. 3 years \nd)  Temporary erections including wooden structures. 1 year \ne) Energy saving electrical appliances and fittings. 2-7 years \nf) Solar/wind power plants which are not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations. 25 years  \n381   \n \ng) Furniture, Fixture, Office equipment and Communication equipment 5-15 years  \nCapital spares are depreciated considering the useful life up to 25 years based on technical \nassessment.  \nRight-of-use land and buildings relating to generation of electricity business which are not \ngoverned by CERC tariff Regulations are fully amortized on straight line method over the lease \nperiod or life of the related plant whichever is lower. \nDepreciation on additions to/deductions from property, plant and equipment during the year is \ncharged on pro-rata basis from/up to the month in which the asset is available for use/sale, \ndisposal or earmarked for disposal. \nWhere it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the expenditure incurred will \nflow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably, subsequent expenditure on a \nproperty, plant and equipment along-with its unamortized depreciable amount is charged off \nprospectively over the revised useful life determined by technical assessment. \nThe residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation of assets other than the assets of \ngeneration of electricity business governed by CERC Tariff Regulations, are reviewed at each \nfinancial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required. \nDepreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale \n(or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with Ind AS 105 \nand the date that the asset is derecognized. \nRefer policy no. C.14 in respect of depreciation/amortization of right-of-use assets other than land \nand buildings. \n3. Capital work-in-progress  \nCost incurred for property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as on the \nreporting date, is classified under capital work- in-progress.  \nThe cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials & direct labour, any other costs \ndirectly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be \ncapable of operating in the manner intended by management and the borrowing costs attributable \nto the acquisition or construction of qualifying asset. \nExpenses directly attributable to construction of property, plant and equipment incurred till they \nare ready for their intended use are identified and allocated on a systematic basis on the cost of \nrelated assets.  \nDeposit works/cost plus contracts are accounted for on the basis of statements of account received \nfrom the contractors.  \nUnsettled liabilities for price variation/exchange rate variation in case of contracts are accounted \nfor on estimated basis as per terms of the contracts . \n4. Intangible assets and intangible assets under development  \n4.1. Initial recognition and measurement \nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at \ncost. Subsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated \nimpairment losses. \n4.2. Subsequent costs  \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is \nprobable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise \nand the cost of the item can be measured reliably. \n382   \n \n4.3. De-recognition \nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use \nor upon their disposal. Gain or loss on de-recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the \ndifference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of intangible assets \nand are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. \n4.4. Amortization \nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight-line method over a period \nof legal right to use or 3 years, whichever is less.  \nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life \nis reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required. \n \n5. Borrowing costs  \nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as \ndescribed in Ind AS 109 \u2013 \u2018Financial Instruments\u2019 (b) interest expense on lease liabilities  \nrecognized in accordance with Ind AS 116\u2013 \u2018Leases\u2019.   \nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ \ndevelopment or erection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such \ntime the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which \nnecessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.  \nWhen the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the \nborrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Group borrows funds generally and uses them for \nthe purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed \nbased on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and \nused for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, \nborrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a \nqualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary \nto prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.  \nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for \nexpenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for \ncapitalization.  \nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare \nthe qualifying assets for their intended use are complete.  \nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred \nThe Group can incur borrowing costs during an extended period in which it suspends the \nactivities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use or sale. Such costs are costs of holding \npartially completed assets and is not eligible for capitalisation. However, the Group does not \nnormally suspend capitalising borrowing costs during a period when it carries out substantial \ntechnical and administrative work. The Group also does not suspend capitalising borrowing costs \nwhen a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended \nuse or sale. \n6. Inventories  \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on \nweighted average basis.  \nNon-moving items of stores and spares are reviewed and diminution in the value of obsolete, \n383   \n \nunserviceable, surplus spares is ascertained and provided for. \n7. Government grants \nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received \nand the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate \nthe Group for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss \non a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. \nGrants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which \nthe related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses. \n8. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets \nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or \nconstructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of \neconomic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money \nis material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax \nrate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to \nthe liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is \nrecognized as a finance cost. \nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle \nthe present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding \nthe obligation.  \nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be \nrecovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that \nreimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The \nexpense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of \nreimbursement, if any. \nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will \nonly be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly \nwithin the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will \nbe required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent \nliability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities \nare disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are \nreviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate. \nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be \nconfirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not \nwholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements \nwhen inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are \nassessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial \nstatements. \nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An \nonerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the \nunavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits \nexpected to be received from the contract. \n9. Foreign currency transactions and translation \nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange \nrates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.  \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the reporting date \nare translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange prevailing on that  date. Exchange \n384   \n \ndifferences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement \nof profit and loss in the year in which it arises. \nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical \ncost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. \nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a \nhyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation \ncurrency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: \n \u2022 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet \n \u2022 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable \napproximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which \ncase income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and \n \u2022 All resulting exchange differences are recognized in OCI.  \n \n10. Revenue \nGroup\u2019s revenues arise from sale of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision \nservices, and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, contractors etc., dividend from investments in joint venture & subsidiary companies, surcharge \nreceived from beneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc. \n \n10.1. Revenue from sale of energy \nA portion of Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the \nCERC. In such cases, Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved \nby the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate \nTribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are \nyet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are \nadopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is \nrecognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a \nregular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each \nreporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries \nbut not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue. \nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized \nbased on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power \nthrough power exchanges. \nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of \nrevenue. \nRevenue from sale of energy saving certificates/carbon credits is accounted for as and when sold. \n10.2. Revenue from services \nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured \nbased on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be \nreceived in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes \namounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when the performance \nobligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a \ncustomer. \n385   \n \nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service \ncontracts. \nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either \nto the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves \nassessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is \nat the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a \ncumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a \nseparate contract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a \ntermination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone \nselling price. \n \n10.3. Other income \nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability \nexist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable \ninterest rate, using the effective interest rate method (EIR). For debt instruments measured either \nat amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is \nrecognized using the EIR to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset and included in other \nincome in the statement of profit and loss. For purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) \nfinancial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying \nthat rate to the amortized cost of the asset.  \nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance \nclaims are accounted for based on certainty of realization.  \nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized \nwhen no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists. \nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims \nwherever there is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are \ntherefore, accounted for on receipt/acceptance. \nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss only when the right to receive is established, it is \nprobable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the \namount of the dividend can be measured reliably. \n11. Employee benefits \nThe employees of the Group are on secondment from NTPC Limited (the parent company). \nEmployee benefits include provident fund, pension, gratuity, post-retirement medical facilities, \ncompensated absences, long service award, economic rehabilitation scheme and other terminal \nbenefits. In terms of arrangement with the Parent Company, the Group is required to make a fixed \npercentage contribution of the aggregate of basic pay and dearness allowance for the period of \nservice rendered in the Group. Accordingly, these employee benefits are treated as defined \ncontribution schemes. \n12. Other expenses  \nExpenses on training & recruitment are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year \nincurred. \nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility \nreport/techno economic clearance/winning of project under tender based competitive bidding \nsystem are charged to statement of profit and loss.  \nNet pre-commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and \nsystems. \n386   \n \n13. Income tax  \nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in \nstatement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI \nor equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively. \nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the \nprovisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of \nthe reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  \nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the \ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of \nassets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to \ntemporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is \na legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they \nrelate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority. \nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to \nitems recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, \nrespectively. \nDeferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred \ntax liability  arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction \nthat is not a business combination and,  at the time of transaction, (i) affects neither accounting \nnor taxable profit or loss and (ii) does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary \ndifferences.  \nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is \nprobable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary \ndifference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced \nto the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. \nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax \nauthority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is \nunlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax \nbases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognised. The effect of the uncertainty is \nrecognised using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the \nmost likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Group evaluates whether to \nconsider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other \nuncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.  \n14. Leases \nAs lessee \nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or \ncontains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a \nperiod of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to \ncontrol the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use \nof an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the \nasset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n \nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease \narrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short \nterm leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short-term and leases for low \nvalue underlying assets, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a \nstraight-line basis over the term of the lease. \n \n387   \n \nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of \nthe lease term. Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably \ncertain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not \nbe exercised. \n \nThe right-of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which \ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior \nto the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They \nare subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment \nlosses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities \n \nRight-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the \nuseful life of the underlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the \nend of lease term or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the purchase option will be \nexercised. Otherwise, Right-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date \non a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.  \n \nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, \nthe recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value-in-use) \nis determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are \nlargely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is \ndetermined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.  \n \nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease \npayments. In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate \nimplicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease \nliabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the \nGroup changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. \n \n15. Impairment of non-financial assets \nThe carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to \ndetermine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - \n\u2018Impairment of Assets\u2019. If any such indication exists, then the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is \nestimated.  \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs \nof disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are \ndiscounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of \nimpairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest \ngroup of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the \ncash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the \u2018cash-generating unit\u2019, or \u201cCGU\u201d).  \nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its \nestimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and \nloss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of \nthe assets of the CGU.  \nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any \nindications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there \nhas been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss \nis reversed only to the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount \n388   \n \nthat would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no \nimpairment loss had been recognized. \n \n16. Operating segments \nIn accordance with Ind AS 108-\u2018Operating segments\u2019, the operating segments used to present \nsegment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Group\u2019s \nmanagement to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of \nDirectors is collectively the Group\u2019s \u2018Chief Operating Decision Maker\u2019 or \u2018CODM\u2019 within the \nmeaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in \nconnection with performance assessment measures put in place. \n17. Dividends \nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Group\u2019s shareholders are recognized as changes in \nequity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors \nrespectively. \n18. Material prior period errors \nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for \nthe prior periods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest \nperiod presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period \npresented, are restated. \n19. Earnings per share \nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity \nshareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during \nthe financial year. \nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to \nequity shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for \nderiving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares \nthat could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. \nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for \nall periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year. \n20. Statement of cash flows \nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS \n7-\u2018Statement of cash flows\u2019. \n21. Financial instruments \nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a \nfinancial liability or equity instrument of another entity. The Group recognizes a financial asset or \na financial liability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. \n21.1. Financial assets \nInitial recognition and measurement \nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables \nwhich are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to \nthe acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are \nadded to the fair value on initial recognition. \nSubsequent measurement \nDebt instruments at amortized cost   \n389   \n \nA \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:  \n(a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting \ncontractual cash flows, and  \n(b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely \npayments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.  \nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using \nthe effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any \ndiscount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR \namortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising \nfrom impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally \napplies to trade and other receivables. \nBusiness model assessment \nThe Group holds financial assets which arise from its ordinary course of business. The objective \nof the business model for these financial assets is to collect the amounts due from the Group\u2019s \nreceivables and to earn contractual interest income on the amounts collected.  \nInvestment in Equity instruments  \nEquity investments in subsidiaries and joint venture companies are accounted at cost less \nimpairment, if any. \nThe Group reviews the carrying value of investments at each reporting date to determine whether \nthere is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount of \nthe investment is estimated. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the \nimpairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. \nDe-recognition \nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar \nfinancial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e. removed from the Group\u2019s balance sheet) when:  \n\uf0b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or  \n\uf0b7 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an \nobligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \n\u2018pass-through\u2019 arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks \nand rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all \nthe risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. \nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable \nis recognized in the statement of profit and loss. \nImpairment of financial assets \nIn accordance with Ind AS 109-\u2018Financial instruments\u2019, the Group applies expected credit loss \n(ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial \nassets and credit risk exposure:  \n(a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt \nsecurities, deposits and bank balance.  \n(b) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.  \n(c) Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.  \n \nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Group applies the simplified \napproach required by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires lifetime expected losses \nto be recognized from initial recognition. \n \n390   \n \nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure (other than \npurchased or originated credit impaired financial assets), the Group determines that whether there \nhas been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not \nincreased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit \nrisk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of \nthe instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since \ninitial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12 \nmonth ECL. \nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the \ncumulative changes in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition. \n \n21.2. Financial liabilities \nInitial recognition and measurement \nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through \nprofit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are \nrecognized initially at fair value and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized \ncost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Group\u2019s financial liabilities include trade and \nother payables, borrowings. \nSubsequent measurement \nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: \nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost \nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost \nusing the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of  profit and  loss when the \nliabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process Amortized cost is \ncalculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are \nan integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of \nprofit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other \ncontractual liabilities.  \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading \nand financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. \nFinancial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of \nrepurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered \ninto by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined \nby Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they \nare designated as effective hedging instruments.  \nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are \ndesignated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For \nliabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is \nrecognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. \nHowever, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other \nchanges in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Group \nhas not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.  \nDe-recognition \nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or \n391   \n \ncancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same \nlender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially \nmodified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability \nand the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is \nrecognized in the statement of profit and loss. \n21.3. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance \nsheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an \nintention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. \n22. Non -Current Assets Held for Sale  \nThe Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying \namounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale \nis considered highly probable.  \nManagement must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition \nas a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions \nrequired to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to \nthe plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. \nNon-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying \namount and the fair value less cost of disposal.  \nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not \ndepreciated or amortized. \nIn circumstances, where an item of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset is \npermanently abandoned and retired from active use, however criteria of \u2018non-current assets held \nfor sale\u2019 as above are not met, such items are not classified as held for sale and continued to be \ndepreciated over their revised useful lives, as assessed. Such assets are evaluated for impairment \nin accordance with material accounting policy no. C.14.  \nD. Use of estimates and management judgments \nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and \nassumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of \nassets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well \nas contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management\u2019s \njudgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in \nthe circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  \nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting \nestimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods \naffected. \nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas \nof estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the \nmost significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as under:  \n1. Formulation of accounting policies  \nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing \nrelevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they \napply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial. \n2. Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \n392   \n \nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a \nnumber of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic \nfactors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of \nmaintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. \n3. Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on \nestimates and assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash \nflows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material \nimpact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment. \n4. Revenues  \nThe Group records a part of revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the \nCERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated \nunder Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates \nare adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. \n \n5. Leases not in legal form of lease   \nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining \nwhether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Group, \nmanagement has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of \nthe transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and \nconditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind \nAS 116. \n6. Provisions and contingencies \nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in \naccordance with Ind AS 37,- \u2018Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\u2019. The \nevaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment by management \nregarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following \nunforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.  \n7. Impairment test of investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Companies \nThe recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries and joint venture companies is based on \nestimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the \noperations of the investee Group. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact \non the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.  \n8. Income taxes \nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, \nincluding amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. \n \n***** \n \n393NTPC RE GROUP\nAmount in \u20b9 Million\nNet block       \nAs  at Deductions/ As at As at For Deductions/ Upto As at\n1 April 2022 Additions adjustments 31 March 2023 1 April 2022 the year   adjustments 31 March 2023 31 March 2023\n2,798.61          519.82            -

Fair Value Measurements \n All financial assets and liabilities viz., cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, lease liabilities, trade payables and  other financial liabilities are measured at \namortised cost. \nThe fair value of borrowings is considered to be the same as their carrying value, as they carry currently prevailing market interest rates. Further they are \ncalssified as Level 3 borrowings as per the fair value hierarchy as the inputs are not directly observable in the market.Also, carrying amount of claims recoverable approximates its fair value as these are recoverable immediately. As at 31 March 2022 \nThe carrying value of non-current lease liabilities has been calculated based on the cash flows discounted using a current discount rate in the current\nfinancial year and is thus considered to be the same as their fair value.The carrying amounts of current trade receivables, current trade payables, payable for capital expenditure, cash and cash equivalents and other financial\nassets and liabilities are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.

In solar projects, we usually take responsibility for procurement of major equipment \nand supplies and the contractor builds , commissions and hands over the solar plant. We also use the turnkey EPC \ncontract model based on specific project conditions. In wind projects, we generally use the turnkey EPC model, \nentering into contracts with OEMs for manufacturing, installing, and co mmissioning wind turbines and the \nbalance of plant.  \n \nOperation and maintenance (\u201c O&M \u201d) services for our renewable energy projects are provided through third -\nparty service providers. We have a strong focus on improving the operational efficiency of our plants. Towards \nthat end, we are employing technologies including  \n\u2022 Robotic dry cleaning of photovoltaic (\u201c PV\u201d) arrays;  \n\u2022 Drone photovoltaic  thermography;  \n\u2022 String Combiner Box (\u201c SCB \u201d) thermography;  \n\u2022 Live dashboards for generation performance monitoring on our plant information server;  \n\u2022 Mechanized module washing, vegetation removal;  \n\u2022 CCTV Surveillance for plant security; and  \n\u2022 Module and string level I -V tracing.  \n \nWe believe that by the use of these O&M technologies and by adopting industry -leading O&M practices, we will \nbe able to maximize and maintain the efficiency and life cycles of our equipment. For more information, see \u201c Our \nBusiness - Operations and Maintenance \u201d on page 226. \n \nWe have a strong management team with extensive experience in the renewable energy sector, in -depth \nunderstanding of managing solar and wind power projects and proven track record of performance. Our senior \nmanagement team, led by the Board of Directors, have decades of experience in the Indian power industry. We \nbelieve that we will continue to benefit from the experience, leadership and vision of o ur management team and \nBoard. For additional details, see \u201c Our Management \u201d on page 252.  \n \nPrincipal  Factors Affecting our Results of Operations   \n \nOur financial performance and results of operations are influenced by a number of important factors, some of  \n437 \n \n \n \n which are beyond our control, including without limitation, intense global and domestic competition, general \neconomic conditions, changes in conditions in the regional markets in which we operate, changes in costs of \nsupplies, COVID -19-related effects on g lobal and domestic economic conditions, and evolving government \nregulations and policies. Some of the more important factors are discussed below, as well as in the section titled \n\u201cRisk Factors \u201d on page 31. \n \nContinued expansion and changing profitability of our renewable energy projects  \n \nOur power generation business and, in turn, our results of operations and financial condition are significantly \naffected by the power generation capacity of our renewable energy power plants in operation and our ability to \ngrow our portfolio of renewable e nergy power plants  by successfully completing and commissioning projects \nunder development. We have till date grown our business by bidding and winning tenders for projects sponsored \nby Central and State government agencies and state public utilities and m emoranda of understanding (\u201cMOUs\u201d) \nand agreements that we enter with our joint venture partners and offtakers. We expect to continue to increase our \ninstalled power generation capacity primarily by completing our solar and wind energy power projects under  \ndevelopment and looking for growth opportunities with PSUs, as well as private corporates. We also regularly \nevaluate potential opportunities to acquire renewable energy assets. As of September  30, 2024, the aggregate \ninstalled capacity of our portfolio of  operating solar and wind power projects is 3,320  MW, and our portfolio of \ncontracted & award projects is 13,576  MW.  \n \nOur expectations on the costs of developing and constructing, and the timing of the commencement of operations, \nof our projects are estimates and subject to delay for any reason, including without limitation delays in securing \nthe necessary approvals, lice nses and permits, failure of our EPC contract ors and suppliers to perform their \nobligations in a timely manner, disruptions at project sites due to labour shortages or disruptions in the transport \nnetwork that brings in our labour for projects, delays caus ed by local and seasonal weather conditions, and various \nother risks and uncertainties. The failure to complete the construction and development of our projects as planned \nor at all could result in higher costs, penalties and lower returns, which could adv ersely affect our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations.  For further information, please see \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 We operate  in a \ncompetitive industry and as such may not be able to acquire rights to develop and generate power from new solar \nprojects through the competitive bidding process. \u201d and \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 We have substantial capital expenditure \nrequirements and may require additional financing to meet those requirements, which could have an adverse \neffect on our results of operations and financial condition. \u201d on pages 49 and 58, respectively.  \n \nPace of development of portfolio of renewable energy projects  \n \nThe pace at which we develop, construct and implement our projects will have a significant effect on our capital \nrequirements, financial condition and results of operations. The implementation and construction of power plants \nrequire us to make significant  advances and prepayments to vendors and suppliers of key equipment and materials \nand to contractors and incur substantial expense relating to project management and employee costs of \nimplementing the projects, interest and financing charges for debt finan cing, costs for land procurement and any \nother expenses for such projects not directly related to asset creation. While such expenses are being incurred to \nimplement the project, such projects will not be generating any revenue in the corresponding period.  In addition, \nthe cost of key equipment and materials could also fluctuate and increase unexpectedly. If the timing of project \nimplementation is shortened or costs of developing and construction of our projects increase or if we identify \nattractive opportu nities to acquire additional renewable energy assets, we may be required to raise additional debt \nfinancing to meet our payment obligations earlier than expected, which may not be available on commercially \nreasonable terms or at all. For further information, please see \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 There  is a time gap between making \nsignificant upfront investments in our solar, wind and other renewable energy projects and receiving revenue \nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and fina ncial condition. \u201d on page 49. \n \nOutput and generation/capacity utilization factor (CUF)  \n \nWe regularly measure the performance of our plants by using the industry measure, generation/capacity utilization \nfactor (\u201c CUF \u201d).  The following table sets forth our electricity generation in kWh and our CUF for our operating \nrenewable energy plants for the periods indicated.  \n  \n438 \n \n \n \n Particulars  Company Operating Data  Carved -out Operating Data \n(1) \nSix months \nperiod ended \nSeptember \n30, 2024  Six months \nperiod ended \nSeptember \n30, 2023  Fiscal 2024  Fiscal 2023  Fiscal 2022  \nElectricity generation  (kWh millions)       \n   Solar  3,117.95  \n 2,907.21  5,590.70  3,759.49  1,863.88  \n   Wind  124.15  \n 66.19  121.78  103.28  103.64  \n   Total  3,242.10  2,973.41  5,712.48  3,862.77  1,967.53  \nCapacity utilization factor(2) (%)      \n   Solar  24.61 % 25.04%  23.97%  22.74%  19.21%  \n   Wind (3) 28.27 % 30.14%  19.78%  23.58%  23.66%  \n   Total  24.73 % 25.13% 23.86%  22.76%  19.40%  \n(1) Our Carved -out Operating Data is based on the carved -out consolidated operating data pertaining to the RE Assets of NTPC \nLimited, NREL and our Company for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.  This Carved -out Operating Data is not our operating data under \nthe leadership of our current management and board.  See \u201c Risk Factors \u2013 Our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements  and Carved -out Operating Data may not be representative of our results as an independent company \u201d on page 38. \n(2) Capacity Utilization refers to the weighted average of CUF of installed capacity in the portfolio as on given date.  \n(3) Wind CUF is lower in Fiscal 2024 mainly due to the commissioning of the new Dayapar wind project during the low wind season.  \n \nWe try to maintain as high CUF as possible by following best practices in the operation and maintenance of our \npower plants. As our operating power plants stabilize and new power plants are commissioned and mature, we \nexpect our power generation operations  to become more efficient and, accordingly, CUFs to improve. In addition, \nwe intend to implement new technologies, including new turbine and solar module technologies, which are \ncapable of higher generation levels.  If we are unable to perform as per the designed efficiency in the case of our \nexisting power generation operations or if our newer power plants under development do not perform as expected \nwhen they become operational for any reasons (including without li mitation unfavourable weather conditions, \nhigh levels of air pollution, and equipment failure), our profitability and our results of operations may be adversely \naffected. For more information on our existing renewable energy power projects and our projects  under \ndevelopment, please see \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 The generation of electricity from solar and wind sources depends \nheavily on suitable meteorological and climate conditions. Unfavourable weather conditions could have a \nsignificant impact on our business prospects and future financial performance. Further, th e physical conditions \nsurrounding the wind turbine generators and solar farms may interfere with the operational performance of these \nassets. \u201d, \u201cOur Business \u2013 Operational Projects \u201d and \u201c Our Business \u2013 Contracted & Awarded Projects \u201d on pages \n55, 216 and 217, respectively.  \n \n \n \nChanges in the regulatory environment, including favorable government policies  \n \nThe growth of the power industry in India and of our business is dependent on the continued support of the \nGovernment, including the promulgation of policies and regulations aimed at improving investments in the power \nsector and encouraging renewable energy. We receive certain benefits and incentives for some of our renewable \nenergy power project s. For example, we are eligible to receive government grants under viability gap funding \n(VGF) for projects under the CPSE scheme & UMR EPP. Any changes in government policies that reduce or \neliminate the benefits and incentives that we receive or expect to receive could have an adverse impact on our \nbusiness and results of operations. For more information on regulatory incentives available to us, please see \n\u201cIndustry Overview \u201d, \u201cRisk Factors \u201d and \u201c Key Regulations and Policies  in India \u201d on pages 151, 31 and 236, \nrespectively.  \n \nInterest rates  \n \nOur power generation business is capital intensive. As a result, we rely substantially on debt financing to meet \nour capital expenditure and working capital requirements. As at September  30, 2024, we had total borrowings of  \n439 \n \n \n \n \u20b9170,574.96  million, which are subject to periodic resets on the interest rate. Therefore, the interest rates on our \nborrowings may change annually if the underlying benchmark interest rate changes. An increase in interest \nexpense is likely to have an adverse effect on our res ults of operation and may increase project costs and cost of \ncapital to us for our operations in project development.  \n \nInvestments in, and development of, new energy solutions  \n \nWe are investing in hydrogen, green chemical and battery storage capabilities and solutions as well as associated \ntechnologies. Our current initiatives in green hydrogen and green chemicals include the development of a g reen \nhydrogen hub at Pudimadaka and finalizing a tie -up for electrolysers. In the area of battery storage, we intend to \ninstall the Grid scale battery storage as part of Firm and Dispatchable Renewable Energy (FDRE)/ Round -the-\nClock  (RTC)  projects to complement the solar and wind power in addition to participate in standalone G rid scale \nbattery energy storage system service tenders in the market for various DISCOMS or Grid balanc ing.  Further, \nwe are in process to install Battery Energy Storage at a NTPC Thermal plant to smooth the flexibilization on pilot \nbasis.  \n \nInvestments in the development and implementation of such new technologies requires substantial capital \ninvestment. The actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may vary from planned projections \nas a result of, among other things, unforeseen delays or cost overruns in developing our products and services, \nchanges in business plans due to prevailing ec onomic conditions, unanticipated expenses and regulatory changes. \nFurther, green hydrogen is not commercially viable as on the date of this Prospectus ; and there  can make no \nassurance that green hydrogen will be commercially viable in future.  To the extent our planned expenditure \nrequirements exceed our available resources, we will be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. \nAdditional debt financing could increase our interest costs and require us to comply  with additional restrictive \ncovenants in our financing agreements. Additional equity financing could dilute our earnings per Equity Share \nand your interest in the Company and c ould adversely impact our Equity Share price. Furthermore, t here is no \nassurance that such new technologies or initiatives will prove successful in gaining customer acceptance and \nachieving commercial success.  Any inability to capitalize on our investment in these new technologies and \ncapabilities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nStrategic consolidation exercise  \n \nEffective as of February 28, 2023, the Company acquired the RE Assets pursuant to the business transfer \nagreement entered into with NTPC, our Promoter. The total consideration paid by the Company for the RE Assets \nwas \u20b9120,105.50 million . Further on February 28. 2023, the Company also acquired NREL as a wholly owned \nsubsidiary from NTPC, our Promoter, for a total purchase consideration of \u20b910,944.64 million .   \n \nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information does not include the financial information for either the business \nattributable to the RE Assets or NREL prior to their respective acquisitions by our Company. The RE Assets that \nwere acquired are included in  the restated consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at March 31, 2023, March \n31, 2024 and September  30, 2024; however, for Fiscal 2023, the profit and loss and cashflows attributable to the \nRE Assets acquired from NTPC were consolidated only for the  month of March 2023. The assets and liabilities \nof NREL are included in the restated consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at March 31, 2023, March 31, \n2024 and September  30, 2024, and the profit and loss and cashflows of NREL are consolidated for Fiscal 2023, \nFiscal 2024 and the six-month period ended September  30, 2024.   \n \nAccordingly, the Restated Consolidated Financial Information is not comparable from period to period, \nparticularly from Fiscal 202 3 to Fiscal 202 4, and does not fully reflect the Company, the business operations \nattributable to the RE Assets, and NREL on a consolidated basis.  Investors are therefore cautioned against relying \non the Restated Consolidated Financial Information as the periods provided are not comparable to each other and \nwill not be comparable for any future financial statements that we may p repare.  \n \nFor the purpose of understanding the combined businesses of our Company, the RE Assets , and NREL , we have \nprepared the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  as at, and for fiscal years ended March \n31, 2022 and March 31, 2023. The Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  were prepared as \nif the acquisition of the RE Assets  and of NREL  occurred on April 1, 2021. Because of its nature, the Special  \n440 \n \n \n \n Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  address a hypothetical situation and, therefore, are subject to \nchange and may not give an accurate picture of our factual results of operations or financial condition. It instead \npurports to indicate the results of operations and the financial position th at would have resulted had the transactions \nbeen completed at the date prior to the first period presented but are not intended to be indicative of expected \nresults or operations in the future periods or our  future financial position.  \n \nIn addition to the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements , we present certain other financial \ninformation, operating data, key financial indicators and non -GAAP financial measures  \u201con a carved -out basis \u201d \nwhich indicate that the information was prepared to give effect to the combination of our Company, the RE Assets , \nand NREL  as if the acquisition of the RE Assets  and of NREL  occurred immediately before the start of Fiscal \n2022.  \n \nBecause of its nature, the financial information, operating data, key financial indicators and non -GAAP financial \nmeasures  presented \u201c on a carved -out basis \u201d address a hypothetical situation and, therefore, are subject to change \nand may not give an accurate picture of our factual results of operations or financial condition. It instead purports \nto indicate the financial and operating information that would have  resulted had the above -mentioned acquisition \ntransactions been completed at the date prior to the first period presented but are not intended to be indicative of \nexpected results or operations in the future periods or our future financial position.  \n \nFurther, the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  and other information  and operating \ndata based thereon or derived therefrom have not been prepared in accordance with accounting or other standards \nand practices generally accepted in jurisdictions other than India (including in the United States), and, accordingly, \nshould not be relied upon as if they had been prepared in accordance w ith those standards and practices of any \nother jurisdiction.  The procedures performed by two of the previous statutory auditors of NTPC on the Special \nPurpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  have not been carried out in accordance with attestation \nstandards and practices generally accepted in the United States of America, and accordingly, should not be relied \non as if they had been carried out in accordance with those standards.  For information on the Special Purpose \nCarved -Out Combined Financial Statements , see \u201c Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements \u201d \nbeginning on page 365.  \n \nKey Performance Indicators and Non -GAAP Financial Measures  \n \nIn addition to our financial results determined in accordance with Ind AS, we consider and use those certain non -\nGAAP financial measures and key performance indicators that are presented below as supplemental measures to \nreview and assess our operating per formance. Our management does not consider these non -GAAP financial \nmeasures and key performance indicators in isolation or as an alternative or substitutive to the Restated \nConsolidated Financial Information and the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Fin ancial Statements . We \npresent these non -GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators because we believe they  are useful \nto our Company in assessing and evaluating our operating performance, and for internal planning and forecasting \npurposes. We believe these non -GAAP financial measures could help investors as an additional tool to evaluate \nour ongoing operating r esults and trends with a more granular view of our financial performance.  \n \nNon-GAAP financial information are not recognized under Ind AS and do not have standardized meanings \nprescribed by Ind AS. In addition, non -GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators used by us may \ndiffer from similarly titled non -GAAP measures  used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non -\nGAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by Ind AS to be \nrecorded in our financial statements, as further detailed below. In addition, the y are subject to inherent limitations \nas they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or \nincluded in determining these non -GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non -\nGAAP fin ancial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with Ind AS. \nInvestors are encouraged to review the related Ind AS financial measures and the reconciliation of non -GAAP \nfinancial measures to their most directly compa rable Ind AS financial measures included below and to not rely on \nany single financial measure to evaluate our business. Other companies may calculate non -GAAP metrics \ndifferently from the way we calculate these metrics. See \u201c Risk Factors \u2013We have in this Prospectus included \ncertain Non -GAAP Measures that may vary from any standard methodology that is applicable across the Indian \nrenewable energy industry and may not be comparable with financial information of similar nomenclature  \n441 \n \n \n \n computed and presented by other companies \u201d on page 84. \n \nThe following sets forth key performance indicators and non -GAAP financial measures reconciled to our Restated \nConsolidated Financial Information or our Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  (as \napplicable) for the periods indicated.  \n(\u20b9 in millions, except for ratios and percentages)  \nParticulars  Restated Consolidated Financial Information (1) \nAs at, or the six months ended, September 30  \n2024 * 2023 * \nEBITDA(3) 9,820.1 3   9,274.26   \nEBITDA Margin(4) 86.69%  90.82% \nOperating EBITDA(5)  9,315.6 5   9,146.10   \nOperating EBITDA Margin(6) 86.07%   90.71%  \nNet Debt(7)  156,020.55   92,913. 65  \nNet Debt / Equity Ratio(8)  1.91   1.82  \nReturn on Average Equity(9) 2.43% 4.17% \nPAT Margin(10) 16.20%  20.64% \nNet Worth(11)  81,891.8 2   50,955.83  \nReturn on Net Worth(12) 2.14%  4.09% \nNet Asset Value per Equity Share \n(in \u20b9)(13) 10.92  10.80  \nNotes:  \n* not annualized  \n(1) Based on the Restated Consolidated Financial Information for six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 .

Basis of preparation and presentation of Restated Consolidated Financial Information   \n \ni) Statement of compliance  \n \nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information of the Group comprise of the Restated Consolidated Balance \nSheet of the Company as at 30 September  2024,  30 September 2023,  31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023, the \nRestated Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including other comprehensive income), the Restated \nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Restated Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six \nmonths ended on 30 September  2024, for the year ended on 31 March 2024 and for the period 0 7 April 2022 \nto 31 March 2023, the Material Accounting Policy Information, and other explanatory notes. These have been \nprepared specifically for preparation of Restated Consolidated Financial Information which will be used for \ninclusion in the Draft Red H erring Prospectus (\u201cDRHP\u201d)/ Red Herring Prospectus (\u201cRHP\u201d) and a Prospectus, \nand any other documents in relation to the IPO (collectively referred to as \u201cOffer Documents\u201d) to be filed by \nthe Company with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (\u201cSEBI\u201d) and other relevant authorities \n(including the Stock Exchanges and Registrar of Companies, at Delhi and Haryana ) in connection with the \nproposed Initial Public Offer (proposed IPO).  \n \nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of:  \n \na) Section 26 of Part I of Chapter III of the Companies Act, 2013 (the \u201cAct\u201d) and  \nb) Relevant provisions of The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure \nRequirements) Regulations, 2018, issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI') on \nSeptember 11, 2018, as amended (\u201cthe SEBI ICDR Regulations\u201d ) in pursuance of the Securities and \nExchange Board of India Act, 1992.  \nc) The Guidance Note on Reports in Company prospectuses (Revised 2019) issued by the Institute of \nChartered Accountants of India (\u201cthe ICAI\u201d), as amended from time to time, (\u201cthe Guidance Note\u201d).  \n \nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information have been compiled from Audited Consolidated Ind AS  \n450 \n \n \n \n Financial Statements of the Company as at and for the period ended on 30 September  2024, 30 September \n2023, 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023 which were prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting \nStandards as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian \nAccounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended (referred to as \u201cInd AS\u201d), the provisions of the Electricity \nAct, 2003 to the extent applicable and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, which have \nbeen approved by the Boar d of Directors at their meetings held  on 30 October 2024 , 17 May 2024 and 15 May \n2023 respectively.  \n \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the company as at and for the period ended 31 March 2024 and 31 \nMarch 2023 have been subjected to supplementary audit u/s 143(6) or (7) of the Act by the office of the \nComptroller and Auditor -General of India (C&AG) .  \n \nThe Restated Consolidated Financial Information is prepared on a going concern basis, on accrual basis of \naccounting and after incorporating adjustments for the changes in accounting policies, material errors and \nregrouping/reclassifications retrospectivel y in the financial years ended 31 March 2024 and for the period 07 \nApril 2022 to 31 March 2023, to reflect the same accounting treatment as per the accounting policy and \ngrouping/classifications followed as at and for the six months ended on 30 September  2024, as applicable  \n \nii) Basis of measurement  \n \nThe Restated consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for Certain \nfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value (refer serial no. C.20 of accounting policy \nregarding financial instruments).  \n \nThe methods used to measure fair values are discussed in notes to the financial statements.  \n \niii) Functional and presentation currency  \n \nThese Restated consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (\u20b9) which is the Company\u2019s \nfunctional currency. All financial information presented in Indian Rupees (\u20b9) has been rounded to the nearest \nMillion (upto two decimals), except whe n indicated otherwise.  \n \niv) Current and non -current classification  \n \nThe Group classifies its assets and liabilities as current/non -current in the balance sheet considering 12 months \nperiod as normal operating cycle.  \n \n2. Material accounting policies  \n \nA summary of the material accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial \nstatements are as given below. These accounting  policies have been applied consistently to all periods \npresented in the consolidated financial statements.  \n \na) Basis of consolidation  \n \nThe financial statements of subsidiary companies and joint venture companies are drawn up to the same \nreporting date as of the Company for the purpose of consolidation.  \n \ni) Subsidiaries  \n \nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group \nis exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect \nthose returns through its power  to direct the relevant activities of the investee. Subsidiaries are fully \nconsolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Group and are continued to be consolidated \nuntil the date that such control ceases.   \n451 \n \n \n \n  \nNon-controlling interests (NCI) are measured initially at their proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable \nnet assets at the date of acquisition. A change in the Group\u2019s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss \nof control are accounted  for as equity transactions  \n \nChanges in the Group\u2019s equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for \nas equity transactions.  \n \nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and \nany related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at \nfair value at the date the contr ol is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in statement of profit and loss. \nAll amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted \nfor as if the Group had directly disposed of the related asse ts and liabilities of the subsidiary i.e. reclassified \nto consolidated statement of profit and loss or transferred to equity as specified by applicable Ind AS. This \nfair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained \ninterest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.   \n \nii) Joint ventures  \n \nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement \nhave rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of \nan arrangement, which exists o nly when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of \nthe parties sharing control.  \n \nInterests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost in \nthe consolidated balance sheet.  \n \nUnder the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter \nto recognize the Group\u2019s share of the post -acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and \nthe Group\u2019s share of other comp rehensive income (OCI) of the investee in OCI. Dividends received or \nreceivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.  \n \nWhen the Group\u2019s share of losses in an equity -accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, \nwhich includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of Group investment in joint venture, the \nGroup does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made \npayments on behalf of the joint venture. Losses recognized using the equity method in excess of the entity\u2019s \ninvestment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the e ntity\u2019s interest in an associate or a \njoint venture in the reverse order of their seniority i.e. priority in liquidation.  \n \nThe statement of profit and loss reflects the Group\u2019 share of results of operations of the joint venture. Any \nchange in the OCI of those investee is presented as presented as part of the Group OCI. Unrealized gains on \ntransactions between the Group and its  joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group\u2019s interest in \nthese entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment \nof the asset transferred. When necessary, adjustments are made to the fi nancial statements of joint ventures to \nbring their accounting policies into line with the Group\u2019s accounting policies.  \n \nThe carrying amount of equity accounted as investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the \npolicy described in D.7 below.  \n \nWhen the Group ceases to apply equity method of accounting for an investment because of a loss of joint \ncontrol, any retained interest in the entity is re -measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount \nrecognized in statement of profit and l oss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes \nof subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously \nrecognized in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the  Group had directly disposed of the related \nassets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or \nloss.   \n452 \n \n \n \n  \nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture is reduced but joint control is retained, only a proportionate share \nof the amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.  \n \nb) Property, plant and equipment  \n \ni) Initial recognition and measurement   \n \nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future \neconomic benefits associated with the item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured \nreliably.  \n \nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement is done at \ncost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.  \n \nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful \nlives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.  \n \nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses \nrelatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.  \n \nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, \ncapitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.  \n \nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering \nestimates/assessments.  \n \nItems of spare parts, stand -by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of property, plant \nand equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized as expense in the \nstatement of profit and loss on consumption.  \n \nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly \nincreasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may \nbe necessary for the Group to obtain future e conomic benefits from its other assets. Such items are recognized \nas property, plant and equipment.  \n \nExcess of net sale proceed of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary \nfor it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is deducted from the directly \nattributable cost considered as part of an it em of property, plant and equipment.  \n \nii) Subsequent costs  \n \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future \neconomic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be \nmeasured reliably.  \n \nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying \namount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the \nGroup and its cost can be measured r eliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized \nregardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine \nthe carrying amount of the replaced part, the Group uses the cost of the replac ement as an indication of what \nthe cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day -to-day servicing \nof property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.  \n \niii) De-recognition  \n  \n453 \n \n \n \n Property, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use \nor upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de -recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are \ndetermined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of property, \nplant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \n \niv) Depreciation/amortization  \n \nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business covered under Part B of Schedule II of the \nCompanies Act, 2013, is charged on straight -line method following the rates and methodology notified by the \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commi ssion (CERC) Tariff Regulations.  \n \nDepreciation on the assets of the power plants and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Company \nnot governed by CERC Tariff Regulations is charged on straight -line method following the useful life \nspecified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.  \n \nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the \nuseful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical \nevaluation/ assessment:  \n \na)  Kutcha roads  2 years  \nb)  Enabling works - Enabling works \u2013 residential and non -residential buildings, including their \ninternal electrification, water supply, sewerage & drainage works, helipads and airstrips  5-15 years  \nc)  Personal computers & laptops including peripherals.  3 years  \nd)  Temporary erections including wooden structures.  1 year  \ne) Energy saving electrical appliances and fittings.  2-7 years  \nf) Solar/wind power plants which are not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations.  25 years  \ng) Furniture, Fixture, Office equipment and Communication equipment  5-15 years  \n \nCapital spares  are depreciated considering the useful life up to 25 years based on technical assessment.  \n \nRight -of-use land and buildings relating to generation of electricity business which are not governed by CERC \ntariff Regulations  are fully amortized on straight line method over the lease period or life of the related plant \nwhichever is lower.  \n \nDepreciation on additions to/deductions from property, plant and equipment during the year is charged on pro -\nrata basis from/up to the month in which the asset is available for use/sale, disposal or earmarked for disposal.  \n \nWhere it is probable  that future economic benefits deriving from the expenditure incurred will flow to the \nGroup and the cost of the item can be measured reliably, subsequent expenditure on a property, plant and \nequipment along -with its unamortized depreciable amount is charg ed off prospectively over the revised useful \nlife determined by technical assessment.  \n \nThe residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation of assets other than the assets of generation of \nelectricity business  governed by CERC Tariff Regulations, are reviewed at each financial year end and \nadjusted prospectively, wherever required.  \n \nDepreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included \nin a disposal group  that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with Ind AS 105 and the date that the asset \nis derecognized.  \n \nRefer policy no. C.14 in respect of depreciation/amortization of right -of-use assets other than land and \nbuildings.  \n \nc) Capital work -in-progress  \n  \n454 \n \n \n \n Cost incurred for property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as on the reporting \ndate, is classified under capital work - in-progress.  \n \nThe cost of self -constructed  assets includes the cost of materials & direct labour, any other costs directly \nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in \nthe manner intended by management and the borrowing costs attr ibutable to the acquisition or construction of \nqualifying asset.  \n \nExpenses directly attributable to construction of property, plant and equipment incurred till they are ready for \ntheir intended use are identified and allocated on a systematic basis on the cost of related assets.  \n \nDeposit works/cost plus contracts  are accounted for on the basis of statements of account received from the \ncontractors.  \n \nUnsettled liabilities for price variation/exchange rate variation in case of contracts are accounted for on \nestimated basis as per terms of the contracts.  \n \nd) Intangible assets and intangible assets under development  \n \ni) Initial recognition and measurement  \n \nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at cost. \nSubsequent measurement is done  at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.  \n \nii) Subsequent costs  \n \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable \nthat future economic benefits deriving from  the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the \nitem can be measured reliably.  \n \niii) De-recognition  \n \nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon \ntheir disposal. Gain or loss on de -recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between \nthe net disposal proceeds, if any, and th e carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the \nstatement of profit and loss.  \n \niv) Amortization  \n \nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight -line method over a period of legal \nright to use or 3 years, whichever  is less.  \n \nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed \nat each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, wherever required.  \n \ne) Borrowing costs  \n \nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in \nInd AS 109 \u2013 \u2018Financial Instruments\u2019 (b) interest  expense on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with \nInd AS 116 \u2013 \u2018Leases\u2019.   \n \nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ development or \nerection of qualifying assets are capitalized  as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are \nsubstantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period \nof time to get ready for their intended use or sale.   \n455 \n \n \n \n  \nWhen the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing \ncosts incurred are capitalized. When Group borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining \na qualifying asset, the capitalization  of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost \nof all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration \nor erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for \nthe purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the \nactivities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.  \n \nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on \nthe qualifying assets is deducted  from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.  \n \nCapitalization of borrowing  costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the \nqualifying assets for their intended use are complete.  \n \nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred  \n \nThe Group can incur borrowing costs during an extended period in which it suspends the activities necessary \nto prepare an asset for its intended use or sale. Such costs are costs of holding partially completed assets and \nis not eligible for capitalisation.  However, the Group does not normally suspend capitalising borrowing costs \nduring a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work. The Group also does not \nsuspend capitalising borrowing costs when a temporary delay is a necessary  part of the process of getting an \nasset ready for its intended use or sale.  \n \nf) Inventories  \n \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on weighted average \nbasis.  \n \nNon-moving items of stores and spares are reviewed and diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, \nsurplus spares is ascertained and provided for.  \n \ng) Government grants  \n \nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group \nwill comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of \ndepreciable asset are recognized as inc ome in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period \nand in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses \nincurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from \nthe related expenses.  \n \n \nh) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets  \n \nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a  past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation \nthat can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle \nthe obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, p rovisions are determined by discounting \nthe expected future cash flows at a pre -tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of \nmoney and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision du e to the \npassage of time is recognized as a finance cost.  \n \nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present \nobligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.  \n \nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a \nthird party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received  \n456 \n \n \n \n and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in \nthe statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.  \n \nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be \nconfirmed by the occurrence or non -occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of \nthe Group. Where it is not probable tha t an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount \ncannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of \noutflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on  the basis of judgment of the \nmanagement/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect \nthe current management estimate.  \n \nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only \nby the occurrence or non -occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of \nthe Group. Contingent assets are disclo sed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is \nprobable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments \nare appropriately reflected in the financial statements.  \n \nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous \ncontract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting \nthe obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.  \n \ni) Foreign currency transactions and translation  \n \nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the \ndate the transaction first qualifies for recognition.  \n \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the reporting date are \ntranslated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange prevailing on that  date. Exchange differences \narising on settlement or translation of mone tary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the \nyear in which it arises.  \n \nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are \nrecorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  \n \nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary \neconomy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the \npresentation currency as follows:  \n \nAssets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet  \n \nIncome and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation \nof the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses \nare translated at the dates of the transactions), and  \n \nAll resulting exchange differences are recognized in OCI.  \n \nj) Revenue  \n \nGroup\u2019s revenues arise from sale of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, and \nother income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, contractors etc., dividend from \ninvestments in joint venture & subsidiary compani es, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed \npayments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.  \n \ni) Revenue from sale of energy  \n \nA portion of Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC. In  \n457 \n \n \n \n such cases, Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except \nitems indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent \napplicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional \nby the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff \nRegulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been  delivered to the \nbeneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic \nand regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered \nto beneficiarie s but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.  \n \nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the \nrates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power through power \nexchanges.  \n \nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.  \n \nRevenue from sale of energy saving certificates/carbon credits is accounted for as and when sold.  \n \nii) Revenue from services  \n \nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the \nconsideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the \nservices, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The \nGroup recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control \nover the services is transferred to a customer.  \n \nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.  \n \nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the \ncontract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the \nservices added to an existing contract a re distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. \nServices added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are \ndistinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at \nthe standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not \npriced at the standalone selling price.  \n \niii) Other income  \n \nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a \ntime proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the \neffective interest rate method (EI R). For debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recognized using the EIR to the gross carrying \namount of the financial asset and included in other income in the statem ent of profit and loss. For purchased \nor originated credit -impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit -\nadjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset.  \n \nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance claims are \naccounted for based on certainty of realization.  \n \nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized when no \nsignificant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.  \n \nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims wherever \nthere is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are therefore, accounted for on \nreceipt/acceptance.  \n \nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss only when the right to receive is established, it is probable that  \n458 \n \n \n \n the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of the dividend can \nbe measured reliably.  \n \nk) Employee benefits  \n \nThe employees of the Group are on secondment from NTPC Limited (the parent company). Employee benefits \ninclude provident fund, pension, gratuity, post -retirement medical facilities, compensated absences, long \nservice award, economic rehabilitation scheme a nd other terminal benefits. In terms of arrangement with the \nParent Company, the Group is required to make a fixed percentage contribution of the aggregate of basic pay \nand dearness allowance for the period of service rendered in the Group. Accordingly, th ese employee benefits \nare treated as defined contribution schemes.  \n \nl) Other expenses  \n \nExpenses on training & recruitment are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year incurred.  \n \nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno \neconomic clearance/winning of project under tender based competitive bidding system are charged to \nstatement of profit and loss.  \n \nNet pre -commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.  \n \nm) Income tax  \n \nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in statement of \nprofit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case \nit is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.  \n \nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the provisions of \nIncome Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and \nany adjustment to tax payable in res pect of previous years.  \n \nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying \namounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. \nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rat es that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they \nmaterialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred \ntax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable rig ht to offset current tax assets against the \ncurrent tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.  \n \nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized \ndirectly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.  \n \nDeferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability  \narises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business \ncombination and,  at the ti me of transaction, (i) affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and (ii) \ndoes not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.  \n \nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that \nfuture taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. \nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer \nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized.  \n \nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely \nto accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax \ntreatment, the effect of the  uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax \ncredits is recognised. The effect of the uncertainty is recognised using the method that, in each case, best  \n459 \n \n \n \n reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the \nGroup evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another \nor several other uncertain tax treatments , based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.  \n \nn) Leases  \n \nAs lessee  \n \nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, \na lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \nfor consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the \nGroup assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially \nall of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the \nright to direct the use of the asset.  \n \nThe Group recognizes a right -of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in \nwhich it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short term leases) and leases for \nlow value underlying assets. For the se short -term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Group \nrecognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight -line basis over the term of the lease.  \n \nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease \nterm. Right -of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option \nto extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.  \n \nThe right -of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the \ninitial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement \ndate of the lease plus any initial dire ct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost \nless accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease \nliabilities  \n \nRight -of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the \nunderlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of lease term or if the cost \nof right -of-use assets reflects  that the purchase option will be exercised. Otherwise, Right -of-use assets are \ndepreciated/amortized from the commencement date on a straight -line basis over the shorter of the lease term \nand useful life of the underlying asset.  \n \nRight -of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that \ntheir carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount \n(i.e. the higher of the fair value l ess costs of disposal and the value -in-use) is determined on an individual asset \nbasis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In \nsuch cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash G enerating Unit (CGU) to which the asset \nbelongs.  \n \nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. In \ncalculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if \nnot readily determinable, us ing the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re -measured with a \ncorresponding adjustment to the related right -of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment whether it will \nexercise an extension or a termination option.  \n \no) Impairment of non -financial assets  \n \nThe carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s non -financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine \nwhether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - \u2018Impairment of \nAssets\u2019. If any such indication exists, then th e asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated.  \n \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash -generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal  \n460 \n \n \n \n and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present \nvalue using a pre -tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the \nrisks specific to the asset. Fo r the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are \ngrouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are \nlargely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups  of assets (the \u2018cash -generating unit\u2019, or \n\u201cCGU\u201d).  \n \nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated \nrecoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses \nrecognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.  \n \nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the \nloss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the \nestimates used to determine the recovera ble amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the \nasset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of \naccumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.  \n \np) Operating segments  \n \nIn accordance with Ind AS 108-\u2018Operating segments\u2019, the operating segments used to present segment \ninformation are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Group\u2019s management to allocate \nresources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors i s collectively the Group\u2019s \n\u2018Chief Operating Decision Maker\u2019 or \u2018CODM\u2019 within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for \ninternal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.  \n \nq) Dividends  \n \nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Group\u2019s shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in \nthe period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.  \n \nr) Material prior period errors  \n \nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior \nperiods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the \nopening balances of assets, liabili ties and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.  \n \n \ns) Earnings per share  \n \nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders \nof the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.  \n \nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity \nshareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic \nearnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued \nupon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.  \n \nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods \npresented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.  \n \nt) Statement of cash flows  \n \nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7 -\u2018Statement \nof cash flows\u2019.  \n  \n461 \n \n \n \n u) Financial instruments  \n \nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability \nor equity instrument of another entity. The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when \nit becomes party to the contractual pr ovisions of the instrument.  \n \ni) Financial assets  \n \n \nInitial recognition and measurement  \n \nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are \ninitially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of \nfinancial assets, which are not  valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial \nrecognition.  \n \nSubsequent measurement  \n \nDebt instruments at amortized cost   \n \nA \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:  \n \n(a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual \ncash flows, and  \n \n(b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of \nprincipal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.  \n \nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the \neffective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or \npremium on acquisition and fees or costs that a re an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included \nin finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the \nstatement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and othe r receivables.  \n \nBusiness model assessment  \n \nThe Group holds financial assets which arise from its ordinary course of business. The objective of the business \nmodel for these financial assets is to collect the amounts due from the Group\u2019s receivables and to earn \ncontractual interest income on the amou nts collected.  \n \n \n \nInvestment in Equity instruments  \n \nEquity investments in subsidiaries and joint venture companies are accounted at cost less impairment, if any.  \n \nThe Group reviews the carrying value of investments at each reporting date to determine whether there is any \nindication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the investment is \nestimated. If the recoverable amount is l ess than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is recognized in the \nstatement of profit and loss.  \n \nDe-recognition  \n \nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) \nis primarily de -recognized (i.e. removed from the Group\u2019s balance sheet) when:   \n462 \n \n \n \n \u2022 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or  \n\u2022 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to \npay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass -through\u2019 \narrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferr ed substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, \nor (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, \nbut has transferred control of the asset.  \n \nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized \nin the statement of profit and loss.  \n \nImpairment of financial assets  \n \nIn accordance with Ind AS 109 -\u2018Financial instruments\u2019, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model \nfor measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:  \n \n(a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt securities, \ndeposits and bank balance.  \n \n(b) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.  \n \n(c) Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.  \n \nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Group applies the simplified approach required \nby Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial \nrecognition.  \n \nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure (other than purchased or \noriginated credit impaired financial assets), the Group determines that whether there has been a significant \nincrease in the credit risk since initial r ecognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 -month ECL \nis used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is \nused. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improve s such that there is no longer a \nsignificant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment \nloss allowance based on 12 month ECL.  \n \nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the cumulative \nchanges in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition.  \n \nii) Financial liabilities  \n \nInitial recognition and measurement  \n \nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or \nloss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially \nat fair value and, i n the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable \ntransaction cost. The Group\u2019s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings.  \n \nSubsequent measurement  \n \nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:  \n \nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost  \n \nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR \nmethod. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized \nas well as through the EIR amortiz ation process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any  \n463 \n \n \n \n discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization \nis included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, \ntrade payables and other contra ctual liabilities.  \n \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  \n \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial \nliabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are \nclassified as held fo r trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category \nalso includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging \ninstruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also \nclassified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  \n \nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \n \nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the \ninitial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as \nFVTPL, fair value gains/lo sses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These \ngains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Group may transfer the \ncumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair v alue of such liability are \nrecognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair \nvalue through profit and loss.  \n \nDe-recognition  \n \nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or \nexpires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially \ndifferent terms, or the terms of an exist ing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or \nmodification is treated as the de -recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The \ndifference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement o f profit and loss.  \n \niii) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities  \n \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there \nis a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a \nnet basis, to realize the a ssets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.  \n \nv) Non -Current Assets Held for Sale  \n \nThe Group classifies non -current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be \nrecovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly \nprobable.  \n \nManagement must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a \ncompleted sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete \nthe plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the \nplan will be withdrawn.  \n \nNon-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and \nthe fair value less cost of disposal.  \n \nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or \namortized.  \n \nIn circumstances, where an item of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset is permanently \nabandoned and retired from active use, however criteria of \u2018non -current assets held for sale\u2019 as above are not  \n464 \n \n \n \n met, such items are not classified as held for sale and continued to be depreciated over their revised useful \nlives, as assessed. Such assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with material accounting policy no. \nC.14.   \n \n3. Use of estimates and management judgments  \n \nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions \nthat may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue, \nexpenses and related disclosures concern ing the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at \nthe balance sheet date. The estimates and management\u2019s judgments are based on previous experience & other \nfactors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  \n \nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates \nare recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.  \n \nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of \nestimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant \neffect on the amounts recognized in the fina ncial statements is as under:  \n \na) Formulation of accounting policies  \n \nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and \nreliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies \nneed not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.  \n \nb) Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \n \nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors \nincluding the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability \nof the industry and known technolo gical advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to \nobtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.  \n \nc) Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \n \nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and \nassumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the \npower plants. Any changes in these assumptions  may have a material impact on the measurement of the \nrecoverable amount and could result in impairment.  \n \nd) Revenues  \n \nThe Group records a part of revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as \nmodified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. \nHowever, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the \napplicable CERC Tariff Regulations.  \n \ne) Leases not in legal form of lease   \n \nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an \narrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Group, management has exercised \njudgment to evaluate the right to use t he underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally \nenforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether \nthe arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.  \n \nf) Provisions and contingencies   \n465 \n \n \n \n  \nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with \nInd AS 37, - \u2018Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\u2019. The evaluation of the likelihood of the \ncontingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential \nloss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.  \n \ng)  Impairment test of investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Companies  \n \nThe recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries and joint venture companies is based on estimates and \nassumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Group. \nAny changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount \nand could result in impairment.  \n \nh) Income taxes  \n \nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount \nexpected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.  \n \nMaterial Accounting Policy Information  for the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements  \n \n1. Basis of preparation for and presentation of Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements  \n \nThis Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  have been prepared in accordance with the \nGuidance Note on Combined and Carve d-Out Financial Statements (\u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued by the Institute \nof Chartered Accountants of India (\u201cICAI\u201d) to reflect the state of affairs,  profit,  statement of  the changes in  \nequity/owner\u2019s net investment and  cash flows  of the NTPC RE Group for the respective years, for use in \nrelation to the preparation of the Draft Red Herring Prospectus, Red Herring Prospe ctus and a Prospectus and \nany other documents in relation to the IPO (as defined herein after) (together, the \u201cOffer Document\u201d) to be \nfiled by NGEL with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), BSE Limited (\u201cBSE\u201d),  National \nStock Exchange (\u201cNSE\u201d ) (together with BSE the \u201cStock Exchanges\u201d) and Registrar of Companies (RoC), \nNCT of Delhi and Haryana in connection with the proposed initial public offer of equity shares (\u201cIPO\u201d) of \nNGEL.  \n \nThe Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  includes the carve d-out business in respect \nof 15 Solar/Wind units (part of the standalone financial statements of NTPC till February 28, 2023) (the \n\u201cCarve d-Out Business\u201d) which has been combined with the standalone financial statements of NREL for the \nyear ended March 31, 2022 and Consolidated  Financial Statements  of NGEL  for the  year ended March 31, \n2023 (the Carve d-Out Business, NREL and NGEL hereinafter collectively referred to as the \u201cCombining \nBusinesses\u201d) .

Since the Statement of Profit & Loss presents the operating results for the entire financial year, \nit is not practical t o determine and disclose the earnings per share in the Special Purpose Carved -Out \nCombined Financial Statements . \n \n(j) For the limited purpose of preparation of the Statement of Cash Flows  for the year ended March 31, \n2022, a Carved Out Combined Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2021 has been prepared by the \nmanagement based on information extracted from the audited financial s of respective entities.  \n \nManagement believes the assumptions underlying the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements  including the assumptions regarding the allocation of general corporate expenses, are reasonable. \nNevertheless, the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements   may not include all of the \nactual expenses that would have been incurred had it been operated as a standalone company during the periods \npresented and may not reflect the combined results of operations, financial position and cash  flows had it \noperated as a standalone company during the periods presented, since the actual costs that would have been \nincurred if it had been operated as a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including \norganisational structure and strat egic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and \ninfrastructure and other additional costs.  \n \nEvents occurring after the date of approval of the financial statements of NTPC, NGEL and NREL for the \nrespective years, if any, have not been adjusted in the Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial \nStatements . \n \nThese carved out combined financials have been prepared on a carved out basis to present the assets and \nliabilities of the NTPC RE Group at these  dates, as if the Group had been in existence as at these dates. As a \nresult, these financial statements may not be suitable for any other purpose.  \n \ni) Basis of measurement  \n \nThe carved out combined financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for:  \n  \n468 \n \n \n \n \u2022 Certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value (refer serial no. C.21 of accounting \npolicy regarding financial instruments).  \n \nThe methods used to measure fair values are discussed in notes to the financial statements.  \n \nii) Functional and presentation currency  \n \nThese carved out combined financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (\u20b9) which is the Company\u2019s \nfunctional currency. All financial information presented in Indian Rupees (\u20b9) has been rounded to the nearest \nmillion (upto two decimals), except when indicated otherwise.  \n \niii) Current and non -current classification  \n \nThe Group classifies its assets and liabilities as current/non -current in the balance sheet considering 12 months \nperiod as normal operating cycle.  \n \niv) Approval of these financial statements  \n \nThe Special Purpose Carved -Out Combined Financial Statements  of the NTPC RE Group were approved for \nissue by the Board of Directors of NTPC in its meeting held   on 29 August 2024, on which an audit report \ndated 29 August 2024 has been issued. Subsequently, these financial statements has been approved by the \nBoard of Directors of NGEL on 7 September, 2024 for use in relation to the preparation of Offer Document  \nto be filed by NGEL with the  SEBI, the Stock Exchanges and RoC NCT of Delhi and Haryana in conn ection \nwith the proposed  IPO of  its equity shares.  \n \n2. Material accounting policies  \n \nA summary of the material accounting policies applied in the preparation of the carved out combined financial \nstatements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods \npresented in the carved out combined financ ial statements.  \n \na) Basis of consolidation  \n \nThe carved out combined financial statements  of the NTPC RE Group have been prepared by applying the \nGuidance note referred above. While applying the above guidance, financial statements / information of the \nentities have been combined on the following basis:  \na) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the combining \nbusinesses;  \nb) Inter -company transactions, balances and unrealised gains/losses on transactions between the entities \nin the group are eliminated;  \nc) Disclose non -controlling interest where 100% shares are not held.  \n \nCarved Out Combined financial statements  are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like \ntransactions and other events in similar circumstances.  \n \nb) Property, plant and equipment  \n \ni) Initial recognition and measurement  \n \nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future \neconomic benefits associated with the item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured \nreliably.  \n \nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement is done at \ncost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.   \n469 \n \n \n \n  \nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful \nlives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.  \n \nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses \nrelatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.  \n \nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, \ncapitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.  \n \nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering \nestimates/assessments.  \n \nItems of spare parts, stand -by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of property, plant \nand equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized as expense in the \nstatement of profit and loss on consumption.  \n \nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly \nincreasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may \nbe necessary for the Group to obtain future e conomic benefits from its other assets. Such items are recognized \nas property, plant and equipment.  \n \nExcess of net sale proceed of items produced while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary \nfor it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management is deducted from the directly \nattributable cost considered as part of an it em of property, plant and equipment.  \n \nii) Subsequent costs  \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future \neconomic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be \nmeasured reliably.  \n \nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying \namount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the \nGroup and its cost can be measured r eliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized \nregardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine \nthe carrying amount of the replaced part, the Group uses the cost of the replac ement as an indication of what \nthe cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day -to-day servicing \nof property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.  \n \niii) De-recognition  \n \nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use \nor upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de -recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are \ndetermined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of property, \nplant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \n \niv) Depreciation/amortization  \n \nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business covered under Part B of Schedule II of the \nCompanies Act, 2013, is charged on straight -line method following the rates and methodology notified by the \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commi ssion (CERC) Tariff Regulations.  \n \nDepreciation on the assets of the power plants and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Company \nnot governed by CERC Tariff Regulations is charged on straight -line method following the useful life \nspecified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.  \n  \n470 \n \n \n \n Depreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the \nuseful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical \nevaluation/ assessment:  \n \na)  Kutcha roads  2 years  \nb)  Enabling works - Enabling works \u2013 residential and non -residential buildings, including their internal \nelectrification, water supply, sewerage & drainage works, helipads and airstrips  5-15 years  \nc)  Personal computers & laptops including peripherals.  3 years  \nd)  Temporary erections including wooden structures.  1 year  \ne) Energy saving electrical appliances and fittings.  2-7 years  \nf) Solar/wind power plants which are not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations.  25 years  \ng) Furniture, Fixture, Office equipment and Communication equipment  5-15 years  \n \nCapital spares are depreciated considering the useful life up to 25 years based on technical assessment.  \n \nRight -of-use land and buildings relating to generation of electricity business which are not governed by CERC \ntariff Regulations are fully amortized on straight line method over the lease period or life of the related plant \nwhichever is lower.  \n \nDepreciation on additions to/deductions from property, plant and equipment during the year is charged on pro -\nrata basis from/up to the month in which the asset is available for use/sale, disposal or earmarked for disposal.  \n \nWhere it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the expenditure incurred will flow to the \nGroup and the cost of the item can be measured reliably, subsequent expenditure on a property, plant and \nequipment along -with its unamortized depreci able amount is charged off prospectively over the revised useful \nlife determined by technical assessment.  \n \nThe residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation of assets other than the assets of generation of \nelectricity business governed by CERC Tariff Regulations, are reviewed at each financial year end and \nadjusted prospectively, wherever required.  \n \nDepreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale (or included \nin a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with Ind AS 105 and the date that the asset \nis derecognized.  \n \nRefer policy no. C.14 in respect of depreciation/amortization of right -of-use assets other than land and \nbuildings.  \n \nc) Capital work -in-progress  \n \nCost incurred for property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as on the reporting \ndate, is classified under capital work - in-progress.  \n \nThe cost of self -constructed assets includes the cost of materials & direct labour, any other costs directly \nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in \nthe manner intended by management and the borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of \nqualifying asset.  \n \nExpenses directly attributable to construction of property, plant and equipment incurred till they are ready for \ntheir intended use are identified and allocated on a systematic basis on the cost of related assets.  \n \nDeposit works/cost plus contracts are accounted for on the basis of statements of account received from the \ncontractors.  \n \nUnsettled liabilities for price variation/exchange rate variation in case of contracts are accounted for on \nestimated basis as per terms of the contracts.   \n471 \n \n \n \n  \nd) Intangible assets and intangible assets under development  \n \ni) Initial recognition and measurement  \n \nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at cost. \nSubsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.  \n \nii) Subsequent costs  \n \nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable \nthat future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the \nitem can be measured reliably.  \n \niii) De-recognition  \n \nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon \ntheir disposal. Gain or loss on de -recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between \nthe net disposal proceeds, if any, and th e carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the \nstatement of profit and loss.  \n \niv) Amortization  \n \nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight -line method over a period of legal \nright to use or 3 years, whichever is less.  \n \nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed \nat each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.  \n \ne) Borrowing costs  \n \nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in \nInd AS 109 \u2013 \u2018Financial Instruments\u2019 (b) interest expense on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with \nInd AS 116 \u2013 \u2018Leases\u2019.   \n \nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ development or \nerection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are \nsubstantially ready for their intended us e. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period \nof time to get ready for their intended use or sale.  \n \nWhen the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing \ncosts incurred are capitalized. When Group borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining \na qualifying asset, the capitalization of  the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost \nof all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration \nor erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for \nthe purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the \nactivities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.  \n \nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on \nthe qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.  \n \nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the \nqualifying assets for their intended use are complete.  \n \nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred  \n  \n472 \n \n \n \n The Group can incur borrowing costs during an extended period in which it suspends the activities necessary \nto prepare an asset for its intended use or sale. Such costs are costs of holding partially completed assets and \nis not eligible for capitalisation.  However, the Group does not normally suspend capitalising borrowing costs \nduring a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work. The Group also does not \nsuspend capitalising borrowing costs when a temporary delay is a necessary  part of the process of getting an \nasset ready for its intended use or sale.  \n \nf) Inventories  \n \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on weighted average \nbasis.  \n \nNon-moving items of stores and spares are reviewed and diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, \nsurplus spares is ascertained and provided for.  \n \ng) Government grants  \n \nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group \nwill comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of \ndepreciable asset are recognized as inc ome in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period \nand in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses \nincurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from \nthe related expenses.  \n \nh) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets  \n \nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation \nthat can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle \nthe obligation. If the ef fect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting \nthe expected future cash flows at a pre -tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of \nmoney and the risks specific to the liability. When discoun ting is used, the increase in the provision due to the \npassage of time is recognized as a finance cost.  \n \nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present \nobligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.  \n \nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a \nthird party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received \nand the amount of the receivab le can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in \nthe statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.  \n \nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be \nconfirmed by the occurrence or non -occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of \nthe Group. Where it is not probable tha t an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount \ncannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of \noutflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on  the basis of judgment of the \nmanagement/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect \nthe current management estimate.  \n \nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only \nby the occurrence or non -occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of \nthe Group. Contingent assets are disclo sed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is \nprobable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments \nare appropriately reflected in the financial statements.  \n \nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous  \n473 \n \n \n \n contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting \nthe obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.  \n \ni) Foreign currency transactions and translation  \n \nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the \ndate the transaction first qualifies for recognition.  \n \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the reporting date are \ntranslated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange prevailing on that  date. Exchange differences \narising on settlement or translation of mone tary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the \nyear in which it arises.  \n \nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are \nrecorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  \n \nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary \neconomy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the \npresentation currency as follows:  \n \n \u2022 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet  \n \u2022 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation \nof the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses \nare translated at the dates of the t ransactions), and  \n \u2022 All resulting exchange differences are recognized in OCI.  \n \nj) Revenue  \n \nGroup\u2019s revenues arise from sale of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, and \nother income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, contractors etc., dividend from \ninvestments in joint venture & subsidiary compani es, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed \npayments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.  \n \ni) Revenue from sale of energy  \n \nA portion of Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC. In \nsuch cases, Revenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except \nitems indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent \napplicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approv ed/items indicated provisional \nby the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff \nRegulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the \nbeneficiary and is measur ed through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic \nand regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered \nto beneficiaries but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.  \n \nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the \nrates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power through power \nexchanges.  \n \nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.  \n \nRevenue from sale of energy saving certificates/carbon credits is accounted for as and when sold.  \n \nii) Revenue from services  \n \nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the  \n474 \n \n \n \n consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the \nservices, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The \nGroup recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control \nover the services is transferred to a customer.  \n \nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.  \n \nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the \ncontract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the \nservices added to an existing contract a re distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. \nServices added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are \ndistinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at \nthe standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not \npriced at the standalone selling price.  \n \niii) Other income  \n \nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a \ntime proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the \neffective interest rate method (EI R). For debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recognized using the EIR to the gross carrying \namount of the financial asset and included in other income in the statem ent of profit and loss. For purchased \nor originated credit -impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit -\nadjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset.  \n \nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance claims are \naccounted for based on certainty of realization.  \n \nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized when no \nsignificant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.  \n \nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims wherever \nthere is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are therefore, accounted for on \nreceipt/acceptance.  \nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss only when the right to receive is established, it is probable that \nthe economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of the dividend can \nbe measured reliably.  \n \nk) Employee benefits  \n \nThe employees of the Group are on secondment from NTPC Limited (the parent company). Employee benefits \ninclude provident fund, pension, gratuity, post -retirement medical facilities, compensated absences, long \nservice award, economic rehabilitation  scheme and other terminal benefits. In terms of arrangement with the \nParent Company, the Group is required to make a fixed percentage contribution of the aggregate of basic pay \nand dearness allowance for the period of service rendered in the Group. Accord ingly, th ese employee benefits \nare treated as defined contribution schemes.  \n \nl) Other expenses  \n \nExpenses on training & recruitment are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year incurred.  \n \nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno \neconomic clearance/winning of project under tender based competitive bidding system are charged to \nstatement of profit and loss.  \n \nNet pre -commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.   \n475 \n \n \n \n  \nm) Income tax  \n \nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in statement of \nprofit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case \nit is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.  \n \nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the provisions of \nIncome Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and \nany adjustment to tax payable in res pect of previous years.  \n \nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying \namounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. \nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rat es that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they \nmaterialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred \ntax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable rig ht to offset current tax assets against the \ncurrent tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.  \n \nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized \ndirectly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.  \n \nDeferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability  \narises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business \ncombination and,  at the ti me of transaction, (i) affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and (ii) \ndoes not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.  \n \nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that \nfuture taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. \nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer \nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized.  \n \nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely \nto accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax \ntreatment, the effect of the  uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax \ncredits is recognised. The effect of the uncertainty is recognised using the method that, in each case, best \nreflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the \nGroup evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another \nor several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncerta inty. \n \nn) Leases  \n \nAs lessee  \n \nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, \na lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \nfor consideration. To asses s whether a contract  conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the \nGroup assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially \nall of the economic benefits from use of the asset through  the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the \nright to direct the use of the asset.  \n \nThe Group recognizes a right -of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in \nwhich it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short term leases) and leases for \nlow value underlying assets. For the se short -term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Group \nrecognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight -line basis over the term of the lease.  \n \nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease  \n476 \n \n \n \n term. Right -of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option \nto extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.  \n \nThe right -of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the \ninitial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement \ndate of the lease plus any initial dire ct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost \nless accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease \nliabilities  \n \nRight -of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the \nunderlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of lease term or if the cost \nof right -of-use assets reflects  that the purchase option will be exercised. Otherwise, Right -of-use assets are \ndepreciated/amortized from the commencement date on a straight -line basis over the shorter of the lease term \nand useful life of the underlying asset.  \n \nRight -of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that \ntheir carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount \n(i.e. the higher of the fair value l ess costs of disposal and the value -in-use) is determined on an individual asset \nbasis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In \nsuch cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash G enerating Unit (CGU) to which the asset \nbelongs.  \n \nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. In \ncalculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if \nnot readily determinable, us ing the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re -measured with a \ncorresponding adjustment to the related right -of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment whether it will \nexercise an extension or a termination option.  \n \no) Impairment of non -financial assets  \n \nThe carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s non -financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine \nwhether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - \u2018Impairment of \nAssets\u2019. If any such indication exists, then th e asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated.  \n \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash -generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal \nand its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present \nvalue using a pre -tax discoun t rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the \nrisks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are \ngrouped together into the smallest group of assets that gen erates cash inflows from continuing use that are \nlargely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the \u2018cash -generating unit\u2019, or \n\u201cCGU\u201d).  \n \nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated \nrecoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses \nrecognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.  \n \nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the \nloss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the \nestimates used to determine the recovera ble amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the \nasset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of \naccumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.  \n \np) Operating segments  \n \nIn accordance with Ind AS 108 -\u2018Operating segments\u2019, the operating segments used to present segment \ninformation are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Group\u2019s management to allocate  \n477 \n \n \n \n resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is collectively the Group\u2019s \n\u2018Chief Operating Decision Maker\u2019 or \u2018CODM\u2019 within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for \ninternal reporting purposes may evolve in connec tion with performance assessment measures put in place.  \n \nq) Dividends  \n \nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Group\u2019s shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the \nperiod in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.  \n \nr) Material prior period errors  \n \nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior \nperiods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the \nopening balances of assets, liabili ties and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.  \n \ns) Earnings per share  \n \nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders \nof the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.  \n \nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity \nshareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic \nearnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued \nupon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.  \n \nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods \npresented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.  \n \n \nt) Statement of cash flows  \n \nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7 -\u2018Statement \nof cash flows\u2019.  \n \nu) Financial instruments  \n \nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability \nor equity instrument of another entity. The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when \nit becomes party to the co ntractual provisions of the instrument.  \n \ni) Financial assets  \n \n \n \nInitial recognition and measurement  \n \nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are \ninitially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of \nfinancial assets, which are not  valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial \nrecognition.  \n \nSubsequent measurement  \n \nDebt instruments at amortized cost   \n \nA \u2018debt instrument\u2019 is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:   \n478 \n \n \n \n (a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash \nflows, and  \n(b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal \nand interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.  \nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the \neffective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or \npremium on acquisition and fees or costs that a re an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included \nin finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the \nstatement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and othe r receivables.  \n \nBusiness model assessment  \n \nThe Group holds financial assets which arise from its ordinary course of business. The objective of the business \nmodel for these financial assets is to collect the amounts due from the Group\u2019s receivables and to earn \ncontractual interest income on the amou nts collected.  \n \nInvestment in Equity instruments  \n \nEquity investments in subsidiaries and joint venture companies are accounted at cost less impairment, if any.  \nThe Group reviews the carrying value of investments at each reporting date to determine whether there is any \nindication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the investment is \nestimated. If the recoverable amount is l ess than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is recognized in the \nstatement of profit and loss.  \n \nDe-recognition  \n \nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) \nis primarily de -recognized (i.e. removed from the Group\u2019s balance sheet) when:  \n \n\u2022 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or  \n\u2022 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to \npay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \u2018pass -through\u2019 \narrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferr ed substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, \nor (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, \nbut has transferred control of the asset.  \n \nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized \nin the statement of profit and loss.  \n \nImpairment of financial assets  \n \nIn accordance with Ind AS 109 -\u2018Financial instruments\u2019, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model \nfor measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:  \n \n(a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt securities, \ndeposits and bank balance.  \n(b) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.  \n(c) Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.  \n \nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Group applies the simplified approach required \nby Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial \nrecognition.  \n \nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure (other than purchased or \noriginated credit impaired financial assets), the Group determines that whether there has been a significant \nincrease in the credit risk since initial r ecognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 -month ECL  \n479 \n \n \n \n is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is \nused. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a \nsignificant increase in credit risk sinc e initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment \nloss allowance based on 12 month ECL.  \nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the cumulative \nchanges in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition.  \n \ni) Financial liabilities  \n \nInitial recognition and measurement  \n \nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or \nloss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially \nat fair value and, i n the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable \ntransaction cost. The Group\u2019s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings.  \n \nSubsequent measurement  \n \nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:  \n \nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost  \n \nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR \nmethod. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized \nas well as through the EIR amortiz ation process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any \ndiscount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization \nis included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This cat egory generally applies to borrowings, \ntrade payables and other contractual liabilities.  \n \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  \n \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial \nliabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are \nclassified as held fo r trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category \nalso includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging \ninstruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also \nclassified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  \n \nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  \n \nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the \ninitial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as \nFVTPL, fair value gains/lo sses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These \ngains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Group may transfer the \ncumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair v alue of such liability are \nrecognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair \nvalue through profit and loss.  \n \nDe-recognition  \n \nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or \nexpires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially \ndifferent terms, or the terms of an exist ing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or \nmodification is treated as the de -recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The \ndifference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement o f profit and loss.  \n  \n480 \n \n \n \n ii) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities  \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there \nis a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a \nnet basis, to realize the a ssets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.  \n \nv) Non -Current Assets Held for Sale  \n \nThe Group classifies non -current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be \nrecovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly \nprobable.  \n \nManagement  must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a \ncompleted  sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to \ncomplete  the plan of sale should indicate that it is  unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made  or \nthat the plan will be withdrawn.  \n \nNon-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and \nthe fair value less cost of disposal.  \n \nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or \namortized.  \n \nIn circumstances, where an item of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset is permanently \nabandoned and retired from active use, however criteria of \u2018non-current assets held for sale\u2019 as above are not \nmet, such items are not classified as held for sale and continued to be depreciated over their revised useful \nlives, as assessed. Such assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with material accou nting policy no. \nC.14.  \n \n3. Use of estimates and management judgments  \n \nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions \nthat may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue, \nexpenses and related disclosures concern ing the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at \nthe balance sheet date. The estimates and management\u2019s judgments are based on previous experience & other \nfactors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  \n \nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates \nare recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.  \n \nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of \nestimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant \neffect on the amounts recognized in the fina ncial statements is as under:  \n \n \na) Formulation of accounting policies  \n \nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and \nreliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies \nneed not be applied when the effect  of applying them is immaterial.  \n \nb) Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \n \nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors \nincluding the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability \nof the industry and known technolo gical advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to \nobtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.   \n481 \n \n \n \n  \nc) Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  \n \nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and \nassumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the \npower plants. Any changes in these assumptions  may have a material impact on the measurement of the \nrecoverable amount and could result in impairment.  \n \nd) Revenues  \n \nThe Group records a part of revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as \nmodified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. \nHowever, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the \napplicable CERC Tariff Regulations.  \n \ne) Leases not in legal form of lease   \n \nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an \narrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Group, management has exercised \njudgment to evaluate the right to use t he underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally \nenforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether \nthe arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.  \n \nf) Provisions and contingencies  \n \nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with \nInd AS 37, - \u2018Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\u2019. The evaluation of the likelihood of the \ncontingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential \nloss. Should circumstances change following unfores eeable developments, this likelihood could alter.  \n \ng) Impairment test of investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Companies  \n \nThe recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries and joint venture companies is based on estimates and \nassumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee \nGroup.  Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable \namount and could result in impairment.  \n \nh) Income taxes  \n \nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount \nexpected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.  \n \n \nChanges in the accounting policies, if any, in the six months ended September 30 , 2024  and September \n30,2023 , and Fiscals 2024 and 2023 and their effect on our profits and reserves  \n \nDuring Fiscal 2024, the accounting of scrap has been modified. Now, scrap generated out of any activity, whether \nsteel scrap or otherwise, shall not be valued. On actual disposal of scrap through sale, the proceeds shall be \nrecognized in Income from Sale o f Scrap/Surplus. Gain on sale of scrap generated out of PPE to be recognized to \nGain on sale of assets account, as is being done now. Impact on profit due to the above change is not material.  \n \nOverview  of Income and Expenditure  \n \nThe following descriptions set forth information with respect to key components  of our profit and loss statement.  \n  \n482 \n \n \n \n Income  \n \nIncome consists of revenue  from operations and other income.  \n \nRevenue  from operations  \n \nRevenue  from operations comprises (i) revenue from energy s ales; (ii) consultancy, project management and \nsupervision fee; and (ii) other operating revenues.

Our board of directors oversees the management of \nthese risks. Our board of directors is responsible to ensure that our financial risk activities which are governed by \nappropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance \nwith our policies and risk objectives. The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of \nthese risks, which are summarized below.  \n \nMarket Risk  \n \nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect \nthe Group\u2019s income. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures \nwithin acceptable parameters, wh ile optimising the return.  The Board of Directors is responsible for setting up of \npolicies and procedures to manage market risks of the Group.  \n \nCurrency Risk  \n \nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on certain transactions that are denominated in a currency other \nthan entity\u2019s functional currency, hence exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises. The risk is that the \nfunctional currency value of cash fl ows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates. The currency profile \nof financial assets and financial liabilities as at September  30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as \nbelow:  \n \n(in millions )  \n508 \n \n \n \n  Currency  As at September  30, \n2024  As at March 31, 2024  As at March 31, 2023  \nAmount in \nForeign \nCurrency  Amount in \nIndian \nCurrency  Amount in \nForeign \nCurrency  Amount in \nIndian \nCurrency  Amount in \nForeign \nCurrency  Amount in \nIndian \nCurrency  \nOther \nfinancial \nliabilities  USD  - - 207.92  17,454.80  - - \n \nCredit Risk  \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to \nmeet its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises principally from trade \nreceivables & unb illed revenue, loans and advances, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and \nfinancial institutions.  \n \nTrade receivables & unbilled revenue  \n \nThe Group primarily sells electricity to bulk customers comprising mainly state utilities owned by State \nGovernments. The Group has a robust payment security mechanism in the form of Letters of Credit (LC).  \n \nThe Group has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of trade receivables in the past year. \nSince the Group has its power stations as well as customers spread over various states of India, geographically \nthere is no concentration of c redit risk.  \n \nUnbilled revenue primarily relates to the Company\u2019s right to consideration for sale effected but not billed at the \nreporting date and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same type of \ncontracts.  \n \nCash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks  \n \nOur cash and cash equivalents are held with banks which have a high credit rating. We consider that our cash and \ncash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.  \n \nThe Group held cash and cash equivalents as on 30 September 2024  of \u20b912,522.53  million ( 30 September 2023: \n\u20b925.61 million, 31 March 2024: \u20b91,156.27 million and 31 March 2023: \u20b9727.46 million). The Group has banking \noperations mainly with SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, PNB, Central Bank, UCO Bank, Federal Bank & IOB, \nwhich are scheduled banks. These banks have high credit rating and risk of default with these banks is  considered \nto be insignificant.  \n \nDeposits with banks other than cash and cash equivalents  \n \nThe Group held balances with banks, including earmarked balances, as on 30 September 2024  of \u20b92,031.88  \nmillion ( 30 September 2023: \u20b94,289.03 million, 31 March 2024: \u20b93,565.16 million and 31 March 2023:  Nil). In \norder to manage the risk, Group places deposits with only high rated banks/institutions.  \n \nLiquidity  Risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its \nfinancial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group\u2019s approach to \nmanaging liquidity is to ensure , as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities \nwhen due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to \nthe Group\u2019s reputation.  \n \nThe Group has an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and  \n509 \n \n \n \n long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining \nadequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast \nand actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.  \n \nThe Group\u2019s Treasury department is responsible for managing the short -term and long -term liquidity requirements \nof the Group. Short -term liquidity situation is reviewed daily by the Treasury department. Long -term liquidity \nposition is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board of Directors and appropriate de cisions are taken according to \nthe situation.  \n \nTypically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a \nmonth, including the servicing of financial obligations, this excludes the potential impact of extreme \ncircumstances that cannot reasonably be pr edicted, such as natural disasters.  \n \nSince billing to the customers are generally on a monthly basis, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to service \nfinancial obligations and to meet its operational requirements.  \n \n(i) Financing arrangements  \n \nThe Group had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:  \n(\u20b9 in millions)  \nParticulars  As at September 30, \n2024  As at March 31,  \n2024  2023  \nFloating rate borrowings     \nCash credit  1,610.00  610.00  5,600.00  \nTerm loans  47,838.09  53,549.20  75,771.59  \nTotal  49,448.09  54,159.20  81,371.59  \n \n(i) Maturities of financial liabilities  \n \nThe following are the contractual maturities of derivative and non -derivative financial liabilities, based on \ncontractual cash flows:  \n \n(\u20b9 in millions)  \nAs at September  \n30, 2024  3 months or \nless 3-12 months  1-2 years  2-5 years  More than 5 \nyears  Total  \nRupee term loans \nfrom banks  872.35  6,553.05  6,911.09  44,336.89  112,773.93  171,447.31  \nLease obligations  198.93  337.62  589.52  1,891.44  24,514.65  27,532.16  \nTrade and other \npayables  918.72  - - - - 918.72  \nOther financial \nliabilities  13,386.64  12,280.67  - - - 25,667.31  \nTotal  15,376.64  19,171.34  7,500.61  46,228.33  137,288.58  225,565.50  \n  \n(\u20b9 in millions)  \nAs at March 31, \n2024  3 months or \nless 3-12 months  1-2 years  2-5 years  More than 5 \nyears  Total  \nRupee term loans \nfrom banks  -    6,322.29  6,668.50  35,864.10  79,119.03  127,973.92  \nLease obligations  357.17  539.01  570.38  1,826.02  26,801.61  30,094.19  \nTrade and other \npayables  624.82  -    -    -    -    624.82  \nOther financial \nliabilities  20,074.77  17,827.12  -    -    -    37,901.89  \nTotal  21,056.76  24,688.42  7,238.88  37,690.12  105,920.64  196,594.82  \n \n(\u20b9 in millions)   \n510 \n \n \n \n As at March 31, \n2023  3 months or \nless 3-12 months  1-2 years  2-5 years  More than 5 \nyears  Total  \nRupee term loans \nfrom banks  -    1,743.10  3,533.51  12,899.61  36,002.19  54,178.41  \nLease obligations  163.23  301.05  336.23  1,061.46  19,617.96  21,479.93  \nTrade and other \npayables  1,022.70  -    -    -    -    1,022.70  \nOther financial \nliabilities  35,320.55  9,168.46  -    -    -    44,489.01  \nTotal  36,506.48  11,212.61  3,869.74  13,961.07  55,620.15  121,170.05  \n \nInterest Rate Risk  \n \nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising mainly from non -current borrowings with floating interest rates. \nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will \nfluctuate with changes in interest rates.  \n \nAt the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Group\u2019s interest -bearing financial instruments is as follows:  \n(\u20b9 in millions)  \nParticulars  As at  \nSeptember  30, 2024  As at  \nMarch 31, 2024  As at  \nMarch 31, 2023  \nFinancial Assets:     \nFixed -rate instruments     \nBank deposits  2,031.88  3,565.16  -    \nSecurity Deposit  849.67  825.03  777.69  \nTotal  2,881.55  4,390.19  777.69  \n    \nVariable -rate instruments     \n    \nTotal Financial Assets  2,881.55  4,390.19  777.69  \n    \nFinancial Liabilities:     \nFixed -rate instruments     \nLease obligations  9,869.72  10,591.89  7,191.64  \nTotal  9,869.72  10,591.89  7,191.64  \n    \nVariable -rate instruments     \nRupee Term Loans from Banks  171,447.31  127,973.92  54,178.41  \nTotal  171,447.31  127,973.92  54,178.41  \n    \nTotal Financial Liabilities  181,317.03  138,565.81  61,370.05  \n \nFair value sensitivity analysis for fixed -rate instruments  \n \nThe Group\u2019s fixed rate instruments are carried at amortised cost.

To our knowledge, except as described or anticipated in \nthis Prospectus, there are no known factors which we expect will have a material adverse impact on our sales, \nrevenues or income from continuing operations.  \n \nFuture Relationship between Cost and Income  \n \nOther than as described elsewhere in this Prospectus, to the knowledge of our management, there are no known \nfactors that might affect the future relationship between costs and revenues.  \n \nPublicly announced new products or business segments / material increase in revenue due to increased \ndisbursements and introduction of new products  \n \nAs on the date of this Prospectus, there are no new products or business segments that have or are expected to \nhave a material impact on our business prospects, results of operations or financial condition.  \n \nSignificant dependence on single or few customers  \n \nOur business is concentrated with our top nine offtakers, since there is a concentrated pool of government -\ncontrolled power purchasers for utility -scale electricity generated by our solar and wind plants and projects . We \nderived a significant portion of our revenue from operations in the six-month period ended September  30, 2024, \nand Fiscal 2024, on a restated consolidated basis, as per our Restated Consolidated Financial Information, and our \nrevenue from operations in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2023, on a carved -out basis, as per our Special Purpose Carved -\nOut Combined Financial Statements  from our top nine offtakers. Please refer to the sections \u201c Our Business \u2013 Our \nOfftaker Customers \u2013 Concentration of offtakers \u201d and \u201c Risk Factors - There is a concentrated pool of utilities and \npower purchasers for electricity generated by our plants and projects. Accordingly, we derived a significant \nportion (more than 87%) of our revenue from operations from our top five offtakers in Fiscal 2024, wi th our \nsingle largest offtaker contributing around 50% of our revenue from operations in Fiscal 2024. Loss of any of \nthese customers or a deterioration of their financial condition could adversely affect our business, results of \noperations and financial condition .\u201d on pages 221 and 32, respectively, for further information on our offtaker \ncustomers.   \n514 \n \n \n \n  \nSeasonality of business  \n \nThe energy output performance of our solar projects is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight and the ambient \ntemperatures. As a result, our revenue in the past has been impacted by rain and sunlight. Our solar energy output \ndecreases in monsoon seaso ns due to less sunlight whereas it increases during winter and summer months. The \nenergy output performance of our wind projects is dependent on wind patterns and wind speeds. As a result, our \nrevenue in the past has been impacted by seasonal variability i n wind speeds. Our wind energy output decreases \nduring the \u201cLow Wind Season\u201d, which generally spans October to March, and increases during the \u201cHigh Wind \nSeason\u201d, which generally spans April to September in any given year.  We believe that the higher levels of revenue \ngenerated during the winter and summer months and High Wind Season can help to mitigate the lower levels of \nrevenue generated during the monsoon seasons and Low Wind Season. Typically, our revenue is the lowest from \nJune to September and highes t from January to March of any given fiscal year.  \n \nCompetitive conditions  \n \nWe operate in a competitive environment and expect competition in our industry from existing and potential \ncompetitors to intensify.

Our Company has filed a petition bearing no. 319/MP/2023 dated August 4, 2023 before the Hon\u2019ble \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission, New Delhi ( \u201c Commission \u201d or \u201c CERC \u201d) against the Power \nGrid Corporation of India Limited (\u201c Respondent No.1 \u201d) and four other parties (collectively \n\u201cRespondents \u201d) under section 79 (1)(a), (c) & (f) of the Electricity Act, 2003 read with regulation 13(8) \nof the CERC (Sharing of Interstate Transmission Charges and Losses) Regulations, 2020 and Regulation \n11 of the CERC (Devi ation Settlement Mechanism and Related Matters) Regulations, 2022. Our \nCompany won 1692 MW Solar PV projects under the Central Public Sector Undertaking Scheme \n(\u201cCPSU Scheme \u201d) Phase -II Tranche -I & II and accordingly signed Power Usage Agreements (\u201c PUAs \u201d)  \n524 \n \n \n \n with Telangana Distribution Companies (\u201c DISCOMs \u201d), out of which 1090 MW solar capacity is being \ndeveloped in Rajasthan.  \n \nPUA entered into between the Petitioner and the Telangana DISCOMs, Article 3 provides for provisions \nrelated to the Transmission / Wheeling of Electricity.  Thereby, responsibility of  obtaining Long Term \nAccess (\u201c LTA \u201d) along with all other clearances, charges, etc. beyond the metering point/delivery \npoint/interconnection point including ISTS/STU charges & losses, cross subsidy charges, etc., shall be \nof the power user, i.e., the Telangana DISCOMs. On July 22, 2022, th e Petitioner vide its Letter addressed \nto Telangana DISCOMs inter alia informed that the Projects have been completed by the Petitioner and \nare ready to commission, however, since the LTA is yet to operationalized, the Petitioner has no choice \nbut to commission its projects through Short Term Ope n Access (\u201c STOA \u201d) under CPSU Scheme Phase - \nII Tranche I & II. The Petitioner being a prudent generator even requested Telangana DISCOMs to take \nMedium Term Open Access (\u201c MTOA \u201d) for its projects, since the Petitioner is facing curtailment of solar \npower und er STOA and STOA did not provide for intraday revision in scheduling of power from the \nproject. Due the delay in procuring LTA, the Petitioner faced issues related to curtailment of power at \nmany instances and incurred financial losses. Consequently, our C ompany filed petition in CERC against \nthe Respondents for recovering yearly transmission charges; seeking compensation towards financial \nloss due to non -operationalisation of LTA and DSM penalties and other related matters. Powergrid Narela \nTransmission Li mited, Powergrid Bhadla Transmission Limited and Powergrid Aligarh Sikar \nTransmission Limited filed their reply on June 10, 2024. Respondent No. 1 filed their reply on June 14, \n2024. Respondents 3,4 and 5 filed their reply on May 9, 2024. Our Company filed  two rejoinders to the \nreplies dated June 10, 2024, and June 14, 2024, both on June 27, 2024. The matter is currently pending.  \n3. Our Company (the \u201c Petitioner \u201d) filed a Petition bearing No. 25/MP/2024 before the Hon\u2019ble Central \nElectricity Regulatory Commission, New Delhi (the \u201c Commission \u201d of \u201c CERC \u201d) dated December 30, \n2023 against Distribution Companies based in Telangana (the \u201c DISCOMS \u201d)  under section 79(1)(a) & \n(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003 read with Regulation 111 Of the CERC (Conduct Of Business) \nRegulations, 1999 and Article 10 of The Power Usage Agreements (the \u201c PUAs \u201d) seeking an in -principle \ndeclaration of the Report namely  \u2018Report of the Working Group in respect of  Data Submission Procedure \nand Verification of Compliance to CEA Regulation  on Technical Standards for Connectivity to the Grid \nby RE Generators \u2019 (the \u201c Working Group Report, 2022 \u201d) issued by the Central Electricity Authority \n(the \u201c CEA \u201d) as a Change In Law event with respect to specified Projects of the Petitioner.   \nBefore the issuance of the Working Group Report, 2022, the Petitioner envisioned and designed the \nproject based on the prevailing CEA Regulations i.e., all equipment of the plant were designed to \nwithstand temperature extremes and the Solar plants were des igned in such a way that the plants can \ndeliver dynamically varying reactive power support so as to maintain power factor within the limits of \n0.95 lagging to 0.95 leading at Point of Interconnection (the \u201c POI\u201d) through regulation of active power.  \nHowever,  the p rocess to be followed to assess the operating temperature of the Solar plant as per Working \nGroup Report, 2022 at which the Petitioner is being asked to demonstrate dynamic reactive power \ncapability while maintaining rated active power output at POI is a new requirement and earlier there was \nno such requirement as per Central Electricity Authority (Technical Standards for Connectivity to the \nGrid)  (Amendment) Regulations, 2013.  Moreover, these requirements call for the installation of \nadditional equipment thus, eventually causing a change in the configuration of the project. Therefore, the \nPetitioner approached the Commission praying to declare the  Working Group Report, 2022  issued by the \nCEA as a Change in Law event in terms of Article 10 of the PUAs; direct the respondents to reimburse \nthe amount as and when incurred due to change in law along with carrying cost and; pass such other \norder/orders, as may be deemed fit and pro per in the facts and circumstances of the case.

A fresh 2020 SGD Notification was issued imposing \nsafeguard duty on the import of solar cells and modules at the prescribed rates. The 2020 SGD \nNotification is an event of Change in Law in terms of the PPA as it has imposed SGD after the bid \nsubmission date, i.e., June 4, 2019, and such imposition was not factored by our Company at the time of \nbid submission. Respondent No. 1, on January 1, 2024, passed an order in favour of our Company \ndeclaring that the 2020 SGD Notification is a Change in Law event in terms of Article 12  of the PPA \ndated October 25, 2019, and that our Company is entitled to compensation on account of Change in Law \nas per the terms of Article 12 of the PPA due to the impugned notifications viz. 2020 SGD Notification.  \nAggrieved by the decision, the Appella nts filed an appeal and two IAs praying to the Tribunal to allow \nthe appeal and set aside the order dated January 1, 2024 passed by the CERC in petition No. 206/MP/2021 \nto the extent challenged in the present appeal and further to direct that the additiona l compensation \ntowards carrying cost -COD and post -COD shall not be enforced and shall be subject to further orders of \nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal No. 8880 of 2022.

Our Company filed its reply on July 1, 2024. The \nInterim Application for a stay order, has been rejected by the Tribunal. The M ain appeal has been \nincluded in the list of short matters. The matter is currently pending.  \n \n7. The present petition was filed by NTPC Green Energy Limited (\u201c Petitioner \u201d) before the Central \nElectricity Regulatory Commission, New Delhi (\u201c Commission \u201d) in view of the disputes that arose \nbetween the Petitioner and Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company Limited (\u201c MPPMCL \u201d /  \n527 \n \n \n \n \u201cRespondent \u201d) in respect of the applicable tariff rate for FY 2012 -13 and 2013 -14 under a Power \nPurchase Agreement (the \u201c PPA \u201d) dated December 28, 2011 entered between with Appellant for setting \nup a 50 MV solar PV power station at Rajgarh, Madhya Pradesh on the terms and conditions contained \nin the PPA. The Ministry of Power, Government of India vide its letter dated March 24, 2014 allocated \nthe entire capacity of 50 MW to MPPMCL. Regulation 8(2) of the Central Electricity Regulatory \nCommission (Terms and C onditions of Tariff determination from Renewable Energy Sources) \nRegulation, 2012 (RE Regulation, 2012) provides that the generic tariff determined for solar PV projects \nbased on the capital cost and other norms applicable for any year of the control perio d shall apply for \nsuch projects during next year.  \n \nThe Commission vide its orders dated March 27, 2012 and February 28, 2013 in Petition Nos. 35/2012 \n(Suo -moto) and 243/SM/2012 respectively determined the generic tariff of the Solar Thermal Power \nProject for the financial years 2012 -13 and 2013 -14 60% of t he project was commissioned during the \nyear 2013 -14 and balance 40% of the project was commissioned during the first month of the year 2014 -\n15. The Commission thus, disposing petition no. 160/MP/2015, passed an order dated March 31, 2017 \n(\u201cOrder \u201d), directe d that granting the tariff of the year 2014 -15 to the Petitioner will result in undue \nhardship as the Petitioner has made efforts to execute the project during the year 2013 -14 which spilled \nover to the first month of 2014 -15. In order to balance the inter est of the Petitioner as well as the \nbeneficiary, the Commission directed that the generic tariff for the year of 2013 -14 i.e., @7.87 (less the \nbenefit of accelerated depreciation) shall be applicable. The MPPCL challenged the Order, alleging it to \nbe cont rary to the CERC, RE Regulations, 2012 which do not permit grant of previous year tariff to the \ncurrent year when the commission of the project was not accomplished in accordance with the PPA. \nMPPCL claimed that they were entitled to higher tariff and that  the Order is perverse and deserves to be \nset aside. The Appellate Tribunal allowed the appeal and remanded the matter back to the Commission \nto hear the petition no. 160/MP/2015 afresh and pass the order expeditiously but not later than three \nmonths. The matter is pending with CERC.  \n \n8. Kaliraj (\u201c Petitioner \u201d) filed a writ petition before the Madurai Bench of the Madra High Court (\u201c Court \u201d) \nagainst the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (\u201c Respondent No. 1 \u201d), NTPC Limited \n(\u201cRespondent No. 2 \u201d) and Ors. Following a successful bidding process, Respondent No. 2 was awarded \nthe 230 MW Ettayapuram solar PV project (\u201c Project \u201d) under the CPSU Scheme Phase \u2013 II Tranche -I of \nthe Respondent No. 1. Respondent No. 2 sub -contracted development of the Project to L&T. The \nPetitioner alleged that L&T unlawf ully encroached and laid the high -tension power line on agricultural \nland owned by father of the Petitioner. Consequently, the Petitioner has filed this writ of mandamus \nseeking a directive from the Court to order the Respondents to remove the high -tension  power line laid \nby L&T during the development of the Project and to grant adequate compensation. The matter is \ncurrently pending.  \n \nOther pending material litigation  \nNil \nLitigation involving our Subsidiaries  \nCriminal Litigation  \nNil \nMaterial civil litigation  \nNil \n  \n528 \n \n \n \n Actions taken by regulatory and statutory authorities  \n1. Our subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (the \u201c Petitioner \u201d) has filed a petition against the Solar \nElectricity Corporation of India Limited (the \u201c Respondent \u201d), before the Central Electricity Regulatory \nCommission, New Delhi (the \u201c CERC \u201d), under Section 79 (1) (a) and (f) of the Electricity Act, 2003, \nread with Regulation 111 of the CERC (Conduct Of Business) Regulations, 1999, for seeking extension \nof Financial Closure (the \u201c FC\u201d) and Scheduled Commercial Operation Date (the \u201c SCOD \u201d) of the 500 \nMW solar power project at Bhadla, Jodhpur District, Rajasthan (the \u201c Bhadla Project \u201d), on account of \ndelay in allot ment of land by the Government of Rajasthan. FC and SCOD are important milestones for \nthe purpose of implementing a solar power project. While FC requires the developers to secure adequate \nfunds for acquiring project land, obtain clearances and permits for  development of a project, SCOD \nensures timely commissioning of a project. The Petitioner had made its best efforts to achieve the \nmilestones within the timelines as envisaged under the power purchase agreement June 1, 2022, however, \nthe delay in allotment  of land by the Government of Rajasthan had a cascading effect on civil, erection \nand installation work for completion of the activities of the Bhadla Project. The said event was beyond \nthe reasonable control of the Petitioner and hence the present petitio n was filed for seeking extension for \nachieving FC and SCOD of the Bhadla Project. The matter is currently pending.  \n \n2. Our Promoter, NTPC Limited and Anr. (the \u201c Petitioners \u201d) filed a petition before the Central Electricity \nRegulatory Commission, New Delhi (the \u201c CERC \u201d) against Indian Renewable Energy Development \nAgency Limited and Ors. (the \u201c Respondents \u201d) under Section 63 and 79(1)(a) of the Electricity Act, \n2003. The petition seeks the adoption of usage charges for a 1990 MW solar photovoltaic power station \nconnected to the inter -state transmission system. As a generating company, the Petitioners partic ipated \nin the bidding  process conducted by the Respondents and were declared successful for setting up the \n1990 MW power station. Following the bidding process, the Petitioners entered into Power Usage \nAgreements (the \u201c PUAs \u201d) with the Respondents. Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003, unequivocally \ndelineates the authority of the appropriate commission to adopt tariffs determined through a transparent \nbidding process, as per the guidelines issued by the Central Government . Additionally, Section 79(1)(a) \nprovides that the CER C has the power to regulate the tariff of generating companies owned or controlled \nby the Central Government. In this context, the Petitioners sought to obtain the necessary approval for \nthe bidding process and approve the PUAs, including the price at whic h electricity should be procured \nby or on behalf of the distribution licensee. The application is currently pending.  \n \n3. Our subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited and Ors. (the \u201c Petitioners \u201d) filed a petition before the \nCentral Electricity Regulatory Commission, New Delhi (the \u201c CERC \u201d) against Rewa Ultra Mega Solar \nLimited and Ors. (the \u201c Respondents \u201d) under 79 (1) (f) of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Respondents \nissued a Request for Proposal (RfP) on January 26, 2020, for a 450 MW grid -connected solar photovoltaic \npower station in Shajapur, Madhya Pradesh. Following a successful bidding process, the  Petitioners were \nawarded capacities of 105 MW and 220 MW at tariffs of \u20b9 2.35 and \u20b9 2.33 per unit, respectively. The \nPower Purchase Agreements (the \u201c PPAs \u201d) and Implementation Support Agreements (the \u201c ISAs \u201d) were \nsigned on November 25, 2021, with a 25 -year duration from the Scheduled Commercial Operation Date \n(the \u201c SCOD \u201d). The CERC adopted the tariff and additionally granted the Petitioners the right to approach \nthe Commission for changes in law. The initial SCOD was June 25, 2023, but due to delays in tariff \nadoption and land provision, it was extended to September 8, 2 023. Further delays were caused by supply \nconstraints in solar PV modules, recognized by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, which \nextended the SCOD to March 31, 2024. However, the Resp ondent limited the extension to February 5, \n2024. Further, the Petitioner cited increased GST on renewable energy devices and new technical \nstandards requiring additional equipment as changes in law. The Petitioner sought to declare the increase \nin GST and  the amendment to Central Electricity Authority Regulations as changes in law under Article \n17 of the PPAs, with compensation for financial impacts. It also seeks an extension of the SCOD due to \ndelays in land allotment and other permissions, which were be yond reasonable control. The matter is \ncurrently pending.  \n \n4. Our subsidiary, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (the \u201c Petitioner \u201d) has filed a review petition before \nthe Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission, Gandhinagar (the \u201c GERC \u201d) against Gujarat Urja Vikas \nNigam Limited (the \u201c Respondent \u201d) under Section 94 (1)(f) read with 86(1)(b) & (e) of the Electricity  \n529 \n \n \n \n Act, 2003 (\u201c Act\u201d). The petition seeks a review of the order dated January 8, 2021, passed in petition No. \n1923/2021, which had adopted the bidding process carried out by the Respondent under Section 63 of \nthe Act. The petition cites that the Draft Power Purchase Agreemen t (the \u201c PPA \u201d) considered by GERC \nwas materially different from the Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process dated August \n3, 2017, notified by the Ministry of Power under Section 63 of the Act (the \u201c Bidding  Guidelines \u201d). The \nPetitioner claims that these deviations were significant and that no prior approval for such deviations was \nobtained from the GERC, thus violating Clause 3.1.1(c) and Clause 18 of the Bidding Guidelines. The \npetition also highlights that the increased GST ra te from 5% to 12% imposed on renewable energy \ndevices and parts significantly impact project costs, yet the PPA does not permit restitution for this \nChange in Law. The Petitioner argues this omission violates the National Tariff Policy and Bidding \nGuidelin es, rendering the project unviable and unjustly treating it differently from other developers. The \norder dated January 8, 2021, is said to have sanctioned these deviations, particularly regarding the change \nin law provisions, without adhering to the proces s specified under Section 63 of the Act. Thus, the review \npetition requests the GERC to revisit its order and direct the Respondent to amend the PPA to conform \nto Clause 5.7 of the Bidding Guidelines, ensuring compliance with the established regulatory fra mework. \nThe matter is currently pending.  \n \n5. Our subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (the \u201c Petitioner \u201d) filed a review petition before the \nGujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission, Gandhinagar (the \u201c GERC \u201d) against Gujarat Urja Vikas \nNigam Limited (the \u201c Respondent \u201d) under Section 94 (1)(f) read with 86(1)(b) and (e) of the Electricity \nAct, 2003 (\u201c Act\u201d). The petition seeks a review of the order dated May 13, 2021, passed in petition No. \n1963/2021, which had adopted the bidding process carried out by the Respondent under Section 63 of \nthe Act. This  petition cites that the Draft Power Purchase Agreement (the \u201c PPA \u201d) considered by GERC \nwas materially different from the Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process dated August \n3, 2017, notified by the Ministry of Power under Section 63 of the Act (the \u201c Bidding  Guidelines \u201d). The \nPetitioner claims that these deviations were significant and that no prior approval for such deviations was \nobtained from the Commission, thus violating Clause 3.1.1(c) and Clause 18 of the Bidding Guidelines. \nThe petit ion highlights that the increased GST rate from 5% to 12% imposed on renewable energy \ndevices and parts significantly impact project costs, yet the PPA does not permit restitution for this \nChange in Law. The Petitioner argues this omission violates the Nat ional Tariff Policy and Bidding \nGuidelines, rendering the project unviable and unjustly treating it differently from other developers. The \norder dated May 13, 2021, is said to have sanctioned these deviations, particularly regarding the change \nin law provi sions, without adhering to the process specified under Section 63 of the Act. Thus, the review \npetition requests the GERC to revisit its order and direct the Respondent to amend the PPA to conform \nto Clause 5.7 of the Bidding Guidelines, ensuring complianc e with the established regulatory framework. \nThe matter is currently pending.  \n \n6. Our subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (\u201c Appellant \u201d) filed an appeal before the Appellate \nTribunal for Electricity (\u201c Tribunal \u201d) against Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission and Ors. \n(\u201cRespondents \u201d) under Section 111 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (\u201c Act\u201d). This appeal challenges the \nRespondents\u2019 order dated August 31, 2022 (\u201c Impugned Order \u201d) in the matter of petition no. RERC \n1905/2021 filed by Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (the \u201c RUVNL \u201d), which sought  the adoption of \ntariff for 1070 MW solar PV power project under Section 63 of the Act.  \n \nThe Impugned Order was passed pursuant to the order dated January 28, 2022 passed by this Tribunal in \nAppeal No. 9 of 2022 filed by Appellant by way of which the Respondents was directed to adjudicate \nupon the remaining Change in Law reliefs and protected the Appellant\u2019s right to challenge the \nRespondents\u2019 findings regarding the denial of judgment passed by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India \nin M.K. Ranjitsingh & Ors. vs Union of India & Ors.  (\u201cGIB Judgment \u201d). In the Impugned Order, the \nRespondents recogniz ed Article 12.1.3 of the Power Purchase Agreements (\u201c PPAs \u201d) and declared the \nchange in the rate of Safeguard Duty, Basic Custom Duty (\u201c BCD \u201d), and Goods and Service Tax (\u201c GST \u201d) \nas a Change in Law event. However, the directions issued by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India in the \nGIB Judgment and the increase in Grid Connectivity Charges were not recognized as a Change in Law \nevent.  The Appellant has alleged that Respondent failed to appreciate the new law, as an order passed by \nthe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India has the force of law under the Constitution of India. Therefore, the  \n530 \n \n \n \n Appellant has sought to set aside the Impugned Order passed by the Learned RERC as being arbitrary \nand unjust.

Pursuant to the UPI Circulars, the \nUPI Mechanism has been introduced in a phased manner as a payment mechanism (in addition to mechanism of \nblocking funds in the account maintained with SCSBs under ASBA) for applications by RIBs through Designated \nInterm ediaries with the objective to reduce the time duration from publ ic issue closure to listing from six Working \nDays to up to three Working Days. Considering the time required for making necessary changes to the systems \nand to ensure complete and smooth transition to the UPI payment mechanism, the UPI Circulars have intro duced \nand implanted the UPI Mechanism in three phases in the following manner:  \n \nPhase I : This phase was applicable from January 1, 2019, until March 31, 2019 or floating of five main board \npublic issues, whichever was later. Subsequently, the timeline for implementation of Phase I was extended till \nJune 30, 2019. Under this phase, a RIB had the option to submit the ASBA Form with any of the Designated \nIntermediary and use his/ her UPI ID for the purpose of blocking of funds. The time duration from public issue \nclosure to listing continued to be six Working Days.  \n \nPhase II : This phase has become applicable from July 1, 2019, and was to initially continue for a period of three \nmonths or floating of five main board public issues, whichever is later.  SEBI vide its circular no. \nSEBI/HO/CFD/DCR2/CIR/P/2019/133 dated November 8, 2019, decided to extend the timeline for \nimplementation of UPI Phase II until March 31, 2020. Subsequently, SEBI vide its circular no. \nSEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2020/50 dated March 3 0, 2020 extended the timeline for implementation of UPI \nPhase II till  further notice. Under this phase, submission of the ASBA Form by RIBs through Designated \nIntermediaries (other than SCSBs) to SCSBs for blocking of funds has been discontinued and replaced by the UPI \nMechanism. However, the time duration from public issue  closure to listing continues to be six Working Days \nduring this phase.  Further, pursuant to SEBI circular dated March 30, 2020, this phase has been extended till \nfurther notice.  \n \nPhase III : This phase has become applicable on a voluntary basis for all issues opening on or after September 1, \n2023 and on a mandatory basis for all issues opening on or after December 1, 2023, vide SEBI circular bearing \nnumber SEBI/HO/CFD/TPD1/CIR/P/2023/140 dated  August 9, 2023 (\"T+3 Notification\u201d). In this phase, the time \nduration from public issue closure to listing has been reduced to three Working Days. The Issue  has been \nundertaken pursuant to the processes and procedures as notified in the T+3 Notification a s applicable, subject to  \n575 \n \n \n \n any circulars, clarification or notification issued by SEBI from time to time, including any circular, clarification \nor notification which may be issued by SEBI.  \n \nThe processing fees for applications made by UPI Bidders using the UPI Mechanism may be released to the \nSCSBs only after such banks provide a written confirmation, in compliance with the SEBI RTA Master Circular \nin a format as prescribed by SEBI, from time  to time, and such payment of processing fees to the SCSBs shall be \nmade in compliance with circulars prescribed by SEBI and applicable law. Accordingly, upon commencement of \nPhase III, the reduced time duration shall be applicable for the Issue . \nAll SCSBs offering facility of making application in public issues also provide d facility to make application using \nUPI. Our Company appoint ed one of the SCSBs as a sponsor bank to act as a conduit between the Stock \nExchanges and NPCI in order to facilitate collection of requests and / or payment instructions of the UPI Bidders \nusing the UPI.  \n \nPursuant to the UPI Circular s, SEBI has set out specific requirements for redressal of investor grievances for \napplications that have been made through the UPI Mechanism. The requirements of the UPI Circular s include, \nappointment of a nodal officer by the SCSB and submission of their details to SEBI, the requirement for SCSBs \nto send SMS alerts for the blocking and unblocking of UPI mandates, the requirement for the Registrar to submit \ndetails of cancelled, wi thdrawn or deleted applications, and the require ment for the bank accounts of unsuccessful \nBidders to be unblocked no later than one Working Day  from the date on which the Basis of Allotment is finalised. \nFailure to unblock the accounts within the timeline would result in the SCSBs being penalised under the relevant \nsecurities law. Additionally, if there is any delay in the redressal of investors\u2019  complaints, the relevant SCSB as \nwell as the post \u2013 Issue  BRLM will be required to compensate the concerned investor.  \nFurther, in terms of the UPI Circulars, the payment of processing fees to the SCSBs shall be undertaken pursuant \nto an application made by the SCSBs to the Book Running Lead Managers , and such application shall be made \nonly after (i) unblocking of application amounts for each application received by the SCSB has been fully \ncompleted, and (ii) applicable compensation relating to investor complaints has been paid by the SCSB.  \nFor further details, refer to the General Information Document available on the websites of the Stock Exchanges \nand the BRLMs.  \n \nBid cum Application Form  \n \nCopies of the Bid cum Application Form (other than for Anchor Investors) and the abridged prospectus was made \navailable with the Designated Intermediaries at the Bidding Centres, and our Registered Office.
